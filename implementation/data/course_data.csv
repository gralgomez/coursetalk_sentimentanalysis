                    Wonderful, wonderful course on learning Python. The professors seem to like
teaching the class (and really seem to like each other, which come across and
actually makes the class even more enjoyable). The lessons and mini projects
are perfectly calibrated to be challenging without being impossible -- after
the first week I started each homework assignment saying ""I DON""T KNOW HOW TO
DO THIS!!"", but then realized that they did indeed teach us everything we'd
need to know to complete the assignment. I think I read there were something
like 40,000 students taking the course. How do you grade 40,000 assignments in
one week? You provide a very careful rubric and you do peer review. This is
actually the toughest part of the class, because your peers are even less
forgiving than the professors would be. All in all, I'm glad to be taking this
course, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Python.

                    Wonderful experience! I'm impressed so much with both the material and the way
this course is organized. Lectures, quizzes and mini-projects were
entertaining and challenging. Still, while I was enjoying and having fun, I
also learned a lot about the language which was new to me. The professors
really love what they do, which is the most important. They put really a lot
of work into this course, so that even newcomers could write applications with
GUI using some OOP. This is incredible! I'm looking forward to other courses
of the professors! It was really a 8-week long holiday to me, despite hard
work upon the assignments:)

                    This class makes itself different from others in a few different ways. The
class works around an open, friendly, and supportive environment that makes
learning easy and welcoming. The professors of the class do a great job of
making things interesting and at times very funny, while at the same time
walking you through learning to program with Python and teaching you the
fundamentals of programming in general. This class is a gem, and something
that everyone should take, regardless of their skill level. I've been
programming/coding for the past 8 years, and was quite familiar and
comfortable with Python before even starting the class. I initially started
the class because I liked the way the professors did things, and I thought it
would at the least be a fun experience overall. I ended up learning a few
things that I didn't even know about Python, as well as alternate ways to do
things I already knew of. And this, in my opinion, makes the class priceless
and well worth the time I spent on it. I truly have to give my thanks to the
professors, to Rice University, and to Coursera. All of you have made a
valuable impact of my life that I will keep close for the long run.

                    66 reviews and only one that's below 4 stars, eh? I agree that this class has
a lot going for it: the professors are smart, cool guys while also being
skilled communicators who explain things well (Mr. Rixner especially -- maybe
he should be the sole instructor). Watching the video lectures, almost
everything made sense while it was happening, and it encouraged me to press
on. But then came the first test and project, which both left me stumped on
several points. I ended up spending hours on each, mostly on scanning the
forums in the hopes of finding a message thread that would answer my question
(I often got lucky eventually, but not always). I'm not sure if it was a
matter of being tested on concepts not covered very thoroughly in the
lectures, or the class not giving enough practice for the material to absorb
properly (there's no homework; maybe it would help?), or whether I'm just
slow. In any event, the frustration, coupled with my subsequent inability to
meet the deadline, inspired me to drop out. It's strange: I always saw math,
logic and analysis as my strong suits. Either I was wrong all along or this
course needs tweaking to be more n00b-friendly.

                    Excellent class to introduce Python and programming in general. This was my
first course on Coursera and I am very happy with the format and interaction.
Having done distance learning and selfstudy courses before I am most impressed
with the student to student and student to instructor interaction this adds
the missing dimension to distance learning bring it up to the level of being
at there. I will be taking other Coursera courses and hope the experience
continues. I have used the MIT open course ware and although it's content was
good it lacked a fundamental part of the learning process, interaction with
other students, instructors and there feedback. This course format gives an
experience very close to being in College and thats something that has been
lacking in distance learning. So well done Rice, Coursera and everyone
involved. Thank you everyone for putting in the time and effort.

                    Overall Assessment: The professors here did a great job of explaining the
programming fundamentals, keeping the videos light and MOST IMPORTANTLY
showing concern/engaging with the students (Joe Warren actually reviewed my
final project in the Code Clinic). Also, I am a huge fan of CodeSkulptor not
only because it is a really easy to use this web based program but also
because I was able to share my games with friends/family and they were able to
play in their browser vs downloading a Python shell. Know Before You Start:
(1) Use the Code Clinic early and often. You can waste a lot of time debugging
and the TAs/Professors are very responsive and can diagnose issues quickly.
(2) Start your mini-projects early. In order to see the solution, I needed to
step away from the computer and if you are scrambling before a deadline
(projects have a hard deadline of 10pm PT on Saturdays), you will get
stressed. Target Audience & Prerequisites: Great class for those with little
to no programming background and looking to get hands on experience in coding.
Probably couldn't become a developer after this class but definitely would be
able to build some cool variations of the mini-game projects. Having some math
background is important but if you know how to use Excel then you will do well
since Python is very similar to writing Excel formulas (lots of ""if""
statements) Difficulty: As a novice, I found this course about medium
difficulty. Learning how to debug took the most time. That being said, the
CodeSkulptor interface is great and the weekly instruction guide for the
projects provide a great walkthrough of how to build a game. Weekly Workload:
There are about 1.5 - 2 hours of videos to watch, the quizzes take at most 20
mins each but the projects are what were very time consuming. Early projects
took about 3 hours to complete but later projects (e.g. Blackjack) were more
in the 5 hour range. A great resource that I didn't really use until the end
was their Code Clinic where you could send in your program and they will help
you debug. Great response time that was typically within 2 hours of sending an
email. What Could Be Improved: The peer grading system is good for ensuring
completion of assignments but I never received any useful feedback on how to
improve my code. The challenge is that when you have to peer grade 5 other
assignments then you just don't have time to go through a debug and provide
helpful commentary.

                    I have no words to describe that fantastic experience that I had in these 2
month. Its the best course ever. I really liked the way it was planned, the
short lectures, the humor and atmosphere, and of course it content. I love
playing computer games (and playing childhood games like pong and asteroids -
own made was even extra fun) and had to learn python for my work, so I got 2
birds in one shot. You guys made these videos, in a way, that I really felt
like i'm actually sitting in your class (and even a small one), so even it was
hard for me to spend the required time, listening, answering the quizzes and
coding the mini-projects, and I'm happy to be able to ""return to my wife and

again, for preparing such a well design and warm course.

                    I already knew a decent amount of Python before this course started which
means I didn't learn that much. (list comprehensions were the only thing new.)
I signed up because I wanted to see how an intro to programming course could
be taught online. I think the professors did a great job. The videos were
clearly designed for internet learning and they tried to be fun. The quizzes
and homeworks had strong ties to the course. Peer review went better than in
some other classes I've taken although I would like to have seen more review
of the code and not just the functionality. I liked this discussions held in
the forum. I learned about pyUnit (on my own) to make the assignments more
challenging - and easier since I had regression tests. Another student did the
same so we got to talk about it. The course also held a video contest where
the winner got an iPad. I didn't follow along with that during the course, but
I think it was a good idea. The course used http://codeskulptor.org as the
development environment which introduced consistency and prevented needing to
download Python. (I had it already and used my Python for pyUnit.) The browser
version didn't work consistently in all browsers. If we are supposed to use
Chrome, it would be nice to say that week 1.

instructors did a great job of making the videos fun and educational. The
Codeskulptor tool made the course hassle free - there was no installing

                    Great course, educational entertainment at its best! \- lectures were well
planned out, making the cumulative concepts presented feel like stacked LEGO
blocks. \- well built tools which encouraged the focus to stay on the concepts
being presented, rather than fumbling around with software compatibility
issues. \- The forums for the course are actively engaged by staff and more
importantly fellow students \- Additional practice code that highlight
concepts need for projects are available including videos by present and past
students were great aids in expanding one's understanding. This is a great
course

great learning experience. I don't have anything to compare with it but I am

had designed a course in a way that no point you feel that things are going

                    The last time I coded was over ten years ago in college. I was nervous and
scared to take this class and feel dumb. This class put my worries aside. I

                    I had almost zero experience in programming before this class. I had taken a
few courses at school, but it was mainly theoretical stuff that didn't even
scratch the surface of this course. The course starts really easy, but about
the mid and on it builds up in difficulty quite abruptly for beginners (it is
mentioned that beginners might find it fast-pacing though, so you should just
have it in mind). However I didn't follow all the excersises and many times I
was running in the last minute to complete mini-projects, so I guess it was my
fault too. I definitely learned lots of cool stuff and I now believe that
programming is not as difficult as I though it was. It just needs planning and
thinking. This course is 100% recommended if you are just getting started!
Lots of thanks to everyone who contributed!

                    I took ""Introduction to interactive programming in python"" as a ""back to
basic"" kind of course and can say that I do not regret my decision. The amount
of material offered, in term of quizzes, mini-projects and pedagogical tools,
is pretty phenomenal for a mooc. This, to me, is what really makes this one
stands out : the programming assignement have been much more sophisticated
than what I've seen in other MOOCs, even those which were arguably geared
toward more advanced students. The same is true of quizzes, which are usually
longer, better elaborated and more complex than what I've seen elsewhere.
(This is the reason I'm giving this course a ""medium"" level of difficulty.)
Combine this with evident passion on the part of the teachers and a talent for
content structuration, and you're pretty close to having a perfect MOOC. I
will be joining M. Rixner and Warren on their following course, ""Principles of
computing"".

                    This course is excellent introduction to python programming. As stated some
High school level mathematics is required but they will help you to remember
forgotten concepts. Video lectures are well planned and fun to watch and soon
you build up your capacity to build fairly complex game program. There are
deadlines to submit assignments twice a week and require regular work on line.
Whatever resources are required, they provide on line including purchased
sound and graphic assets for use in your programming.. You need to use Chrome
or Firefox but it does not work in all brousers You will certainly enjoy it
all throughout this program.

Python and I will continue the series of classes taught by Scott and Joe:) I
liked the way the theoretical notions were explained - the videos were clear
and perfectly timed (not too short and not too long either). The practice
exercises where an excellent way to apply and better understand the notions
and the mini-projects were very well structured, helping me understand the
""programming thinking"". And despite the occasionally annoying little bugs in
the code, nothing compares to the awesome feeling you have when you finally
make your program work:) All in all, an excellent course!

never boring. The games that are made as mini-projects are actually fun to
play as well. Moreover, the concepts and possibilities of object-oriented
programming are demonstrated very powerfully this way. This was an all-around
excellent class that I enjoyed very much.

                    An absolutely great course for beginners. I'd recommend it to anyone looking
to get into game development, as the course projects are games, though what
you learn is applicable across different programing domains, The Profesors are
wonderful and quite active with the community, which itself is very supportive
and great. If you are looking for a good starting point into game programig,
this is it!

                    I had some prior knowledge of programming in Python, particularly in using the
language for computational purposes. I decided to check out this course
because of its description as an introduction to interactive programming. I
did not plan on going through with all the assignments. However, I found that
I enjoyed the course very much, and went on to do all the assignments. The
program was put together very well, and I appreciated all the hard work that
had obviously gone into putting the course together. I am looking forward to
taking the next course in the series.

                    I thought the Python class was very good. I'm already a programmer but I
wanted to learn Python, as it is one of the core languages used by my employer
(Google). The class teaches the basics of the Python language, but what makes
the course engaging is that it uses game programming as the basis for homework
and project assignments. I didn't know anything about game programming, so I
actually learned some interesting things I wasn't expecting to learn. Yes the
course is work (don't underestimate the required number of hours to complete
the mini-projects), but it turned out to be fun work. I can recommend the
class for anyone, at any programming skill level.

incredibly fun too! Instead of developing complex statistical algorithms, the

ready to help students. * Forums are very active. * There are interesting
projects every week and since the class is game oriented that means a new game
per week!. * As a bonus, there is no need to install Python, professor Rixner
developed codeskulptor.org specifically for this class and it's fantastic. *
The professors are awesome, very committed and funny. If you are new to
programming, don't be afraid, this course is perfect. The pace is just right
and the mini-projects (games) at the end of each week have the right level of
challenge (and you can share them with your friends by sending the link!). If

                    I was already taking another coursera class in programming in Python and
thought this course might be a good addition. The other course, from U of
Toronto, was narrower in scope with more carefully organized/clear lessons,
but this course had much more challenging projects that helped me get the
concepts down more effectively. I think they worked very well simultaneously!
This is a fun and challenging course - if you're new to programming, you'll
get some valuable experience in frustration and the reward of getting past it

                    This was the first online programming course that I have taken, I am a
complete novice and I have previously tried learning from books. The way this
course was structured really helped to focus what I was doing. The lectures
are not only very informative, but a lot of fun as well, and I will certainly
miss watching them each week. The course is a combination of lectures, quizzes
and mini-projects. There is a logical progression to the teaching and how to
implement the mini-projects introducing you to many aspects of Python. By
using games as your mini-projects and coding in a browser, you can easily
share your programs with friends and family, I found this incredibly fun as
they not only bug tested, but also gave me many ideas of new things to
implement, leading me to experiment with my coding. The buzz you get on
completing something that initially seems quite daunting, but when broken down
into small steps is very manageable, is truly incredible. I will actually
really miss this feeling as the course has now come to an end. I thoroughly
recommend this course, it is very well taught and a lot of fun!

The course moves very fast, so if you don't have a mind for logic or

possible to go from never having written a stitch of code to writing

                    I had no experience with Python, but after 8 weeks I feel I am pretty solid on
the basics. The course begins at moderate difficulty, but progresses to
difficult. I put a lot of work into it, but nowhere near what the instructors
put into it. They monitored how people were doing on projects and provided
help and hints to keep me going. The quizzes seemed to be a layer of learning
for me, because I could retake them up to 5 times to continue to improve. I
learned a lot from doing quizzes. The projects each week are great for
utilizing what is learned in lectures with the result of a working game when
completed.

                    A first rate class from a first rate University. The videos are fun to watch,
the banter between Scott and Joe is very entertaining. John's programming tips
are definitely worth taking time over. This is what Coursera should be about;
this is the third Coursera course that I've completed so far, and by far the
best. It's challenging, but completely doable. There's something here for
beginners and for Advanced Programmers alike. You'll take away knowledge. Do
it...

                    The course was a lot of fun while also teaching the basics of computer
programming. It's a beginner course but people from all levels could use this
course to learn Python. I had a computer science background and still got a
lot out of the course because I had never used Python. All projects are games
which makes them fun to code. I suggest that people are comfortable with math
and have some knowledge of programming or scripting. If not much time will be
spent in trying to understand the basics. The class is short which is good but
can be overwhelming to a total newbie. I've never had as much fun at a
computer course as this one.

Also codeskulptor! Thank's Scott! It really powerful tool!
But content... why didn't I assess the content as ""5""? Because simplegui. This library works only in codesculptor (I know there is some libraries similar to it, but...) and this library is basement of this course no any other library in this course.

                    I've coding for the web many years, after starting a new job looking after a database for a genetics lab I figured it was time to learn Python. I have been blown away at how well the course is put together and its content. Continuous humour throughout the course which made it fun to learn. Not only did I learn a lot from the course but it is now my favourite coding language and am eagerly looking for Python projects. I can't recommend this course enough. The only criticism I have is the penalty for late submissions. 1 minute late, you lose 50% of the grade, other courses on coursera I am doing do 10% per day late, which to me with a full time job, 3 hours of commuting a day and studying three courses seemed fairer. But don't let that put you off! These guys are great. I highly recommend. I look forward to continuing studying with them as I do more courses from these guys which I have already paid for a glad for it.

                    Wow, what a great course. I am 66, began programming in Basic at Dartmouth in 1967, continued on learning Cobol and Fortran for business (with punch cards) and finished up at Harvard with Pascal. I haven't worked in what we called MIS since 1987, so while I knew of object-oriented programming, I never quite understood how or why one would use it. I also had no real interest in gaming. A young college graduate friend toying with idea of game development as a career asked me my advice. I suggested that I would find an online course and we would take it together and he could find out if it was something that might work for him. He dropped out after part 1 ( he had a life), but I was hooked and continued.
Far and away the most organized class I have ever taken. The lectures, quizzes and mini-projects built on one another beautifully. Everything was there to complete the projects---and on several occasions I even went to the forum for some hints. Not as much fun as helping a young woman after class at a coffee house, but more effective. In particular, your roadmaps for attacking the mini-projects were invaluable. I couldn't have completed the projects without them. Also, telling us which data structure to use saved a lot of time and pain. Those decisions are often more important than the actual programming. I admit, I probably spent about 15 hours a week on the course, and without the lure of a grade or a paycheck, it was sometimes challenging. But I am terribly pleased and impressed with my final project. I wish I had friends that would appreciate what I have done. I even wish they had a follow up course.

                    It is a very good and fun class with a nice teaching style. I think it is a very good idea to use games as projects. I had a prior knowledge of object oriented programming in Java and it was still fun and good knowledge that I got out of this class. It reminded me of some concepts that I kind of forgot already and showed me new stuff, too. Most importantly it shows everybody that programming is fun! Thank you for this class! And thank you coursera for the platform and certificates.

                    I really enjoying this class , the content is really good . I would of preferred to use the python program instead of using codeskulptor because i have got used to it and now I would need to learn different names of the modules instead of simplegui.
The course is really enjoyable , the videos are really good and the instructors (Joe and Scott) are really good teachers and they are funny. They sometimes play games with each other it is enjoyable to watch.
The mini projects are good  however there is only week to submit which doesn't feel like a long time because I had to watch all the videos first to try to understand it and there are quizzes that need to be completed too within the same week ( it is a lot to do).

I created some games in python from this course such as blackjack, ping pong and asteroids.

There is forum and email to help with any questions that you might have.

                    I can not think of a better introduction to programming or Python class than this one. You can really tell the instructors have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort in putting together the course material and refining it over time.  The instructional videos are put together well with a good sense of humor keeping you engaged, fully preparing you for the quizzes and mini-projects.

I took this class as it is a part of a learning curriculum from my employer along with Part 2. I've been so impressed with the instructors that I've already signed up for the follow-up classes 'Principles of Computing' even though it's not a required course for me. I know I'm going to learn and these guys  do an excellent job in teaching.

                    I really liked this course. I do not work as a professional programmer, but I did programming during colleague. I've been willing to resume and expand my programming experiences for some time now. I've been also willing to learn the basis of how simple video games are programmed. Satisfactory, I've found that this course has fulfilled my expectations for both goals. I really encourage to take this course as it worth your time and effort.

                    All very much! I love you! It was great to learn from these great teachers, just a dream. My mistake is that I signed up for training, with a low level of English proficiency. Zero programming knowledge, by contrast, does not prevent - the explanation is very affordable and simple. Russian subtitles were not in every video - and therefore had to translate English subtitles through Google Translate and revise :) twice. But increased their English) At the end of the course was very complicated, time to complete assignments missed. But I'm glad I tried. Thank you for the opportunity!

That said, these mini-projects weren't too easy at all and finishing them and seeing the result get you a feeling of accomplishment.
The instructors are great, they teach the material well  and the way the quizzes and projects are presented make you really work on the concepts.

                    One of the best ways to learning is having fun while doing it. This course lets you build a game every week while taking you through the basics of python!. You can only build so many games in a 5 week class. One per week is awesome enough!!

                    This course is for beginners with little or no experience programming. Each week the instructors add more tools and complexity and then provide fun ""mini-projects"" that let us use what we've learned. The instructors prepared us for each project not just with great lectures but also with challenging questions and exercises. The climax of the course was a project that consisted of making a simplified version of the classic Asteroid game. I found working on these projects exciting and fun and I felt a little sad when the class ended.

                    Great course for those wanting an interesting introduction to object-orientated programming. Fun too.

The course is well paced with weekly mini-projects and quizzes which encourage the student to practise the taught material.

As someone with a little programming experience, I was looking to learn what the advantages of using an object-orientated approach would give.  The course provides superb examples of the power of this type of programming.

                    I had some small experience with Java before the class but not much. It was very well structured to teach the material to a large array of skill levels.
Every part of the course builds upon the last, and the material ramp up is gradual and controlled.
The instructors are very set on making sure you learn knowledge that will transfer beyond the course. The only things that won't transfer are specific to the coding environment used.

                    I believe it is in my nature to be  a little bit ""difficult"" about giving five stars, or ""excellent"" as a rate. This time before clicking on stars besides, I started to think about my expectations and what this course, material, instructors or environment could give me more. I soon realized that ""none"" was the true answer to my question. I give 5 stars to the content because I started from zero and now I am thinking about my next programming project. I give five stars to the instructors because they did a great job  teaching and helping me get the best out the course and a plus for their humorous attitude. I believe they have spent lots of hours building it, and it shows. Great job guys. Finally, I give five stars to the provider (coursera) because of the easiness and usability of their environment. Great job there too guys. This was my first course at coursera, but I am sure many of them will follow. I fully recommended it. Thank you all!

                    This class is fun, challenging, and entertaining. The instructors are very helpful in showing basic examples and then stretching your knowledge to help you become more creative in the way you develop your code. The variety of instructors also attributes to the different styles of learning. The lectures include writing basic code, snippets of example code and lecture notes on evernote. I really enjoyed this class and would recommend this course to anyone interested in coding in python.

I'm an experienced programmer, working mainly with Matlab, and I really enjoyed and learned a lot in this course.
I will surely see you in the other two courses, hopefully there are more to come.

Keep up the great work!!!

                    Great course that took me from 0 to 59 mph.  Not quite to 60 but that will come with time.  It is fast moving and a novice like me will need to use the TAs a lot and find example code to break conceptual log jams.  But, the purpose is learning so whatever works best for you is what you need to do to learn the material.

I came in just learning the language and got a lot more out of the class than I expected because of Codeskulptor and the focus on interactive games. The instructors and those who worked to put this class together did an amazing job. I found the mini-projects very entertaining and engaging. I am now looking for a more advanced class to take my skills to the next level.

Nice instructions to finish the homework which makes us easier to finish the homework without spending too much time on it because a lot of people have to work in the day, only weekend or night available.

Great course!

                    Great course - the best I've done in my University / Professional training.  I recommend this to my friends / colleagues.
If you have some prior Python knowledge - or can pick it up quickly - then you are at an advantage.  Personally I found my occasional use of Visual Basic / VBA and Javascript helpful to understand the event driven model and the object orientated aspects.  Also I'd done a low level Python course before on the basic syntax and flow control (all covered in this course, true...but if you've done it before this helps).
Joe, Scott and John - and the other course tutors - are really good at what they do and have fun doing it clearly.
That the course gives you very visual results from week 1 is very good; that this is done in a WWW browser framework (supplied as a Javascript library: just access the WWW page) means that it is very easy to get started and take it to a high level.
The the art work for ships, cards, rocks etc. is all supplied helps a lot for those of us who are 'artistically challenged' to great something that looks good.
On thing I missed - and hence struggled with - was the coverage of 'program state model' from a strategic perspective: events happen, how to record these when the event code finishes?
Still all in: very good.  
Note that  course material is not released 'in advance' which makes it difficult to get ahead in the material so you can have a break / catch up for vacation / illness: each week there is a Quiz or two (generally easy, 5 attempts allowed) an assignment (the focus: so harder..) and assessment of the previous week's project (except Wk 1!) every week.  Something is 'Due' every 4 days maximum; in other words it is just like being at University proper.

                    An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is a wonderful course. The presentation of the topics is interesting and fun. I love teacher’s sense of humor it always make me smile and want to learn more. The course is for beginners but that doesn’t mean is easy all the time. There are some challenging ideas but teachers give you all the tools that you need to get it and all the effort you are going to put in understanding them is worth it. And when you finally make your own game, that works and looks really good, the satisfaction you will feel is unbelievable. After this course I realize that I want to be a programmer and it was the first step towards my new career.  It was a great journey and I recommend it to all of you who want to learn Python in a more fun and a little challenging way.

                    Of the 20+ MOOCs that I've engaged with over the past year or so, this one was the most fun and provided me the most confidence in my competence in the subject matter.  The experience of building classic games while learning the Python language really makes learning more exciting and keeps you disciplined to continue through all of the assignments.  And perhaps the best part of completing the course is that at the end you have a handful of fun browser-based games that you can proudly share with your friends and family!

                    It was a great course. It really can make an absolute newbie to feel confident by the end of the course - confident to be able to learn programming.
The tasks consist in quizzes and mini-projects. Quizzes are very useful and relevant (!), in my opinion. Not too simple, not too hard. The mini-progects are the essense of the course, they take 80 % of time, so I won't speak about them :)
What is really great - it is codeskulptor.org and the code examples there! I will surely continue to use it after the course. CodeSkulptor is a python simpeGUI written by an instructor. Each code used in video lectures was given to us as a link, so that we could play with it, modify, study... That was extremely useful. There were several weeks in the beginnig, when I didn't need to open the videos! Studying the pieces of code provided there, where everything was explained in the comments + reading the documentation (provided by the course, too) made it possible to make the mini-projects.

                    Course content is awesome - I've been able to finish all tasks, and received all needed knowledge before I started to do it.
Instructors are incredibly great - they made lectures really not boring and still informative.
Course provider is really good - I had possibility to get these knowledges for free, but only one bad thing is that it is impossible to access the video lectures after the course is finished.

The class material and supporting material was very well organized and helpful. The presentation was excellent. 

CodeSkulptor tool was very easy to use and specially the Viz mode was excellent in debugging. The Object Oriented concept and assignments was my first experience in programming.

Overall it was a enjoyable learning experience. I will highly recommend to my friends and family.

                    Both modules of the class were really great. 
Each week there are a few video, optional practice exercices, 2 small Quizzes and a project (in form of a small game). All in all it must have taken me about 10 hours every week (less for simple projects and then more when the projects got more complex). The videos were both very useful, informative and funny and they taught all we really needed to know to get through the class and program little games.

There were a lot of videos that explained, taught, and informed about what we were to learn that week and the mini-projects helped to cement all of the concepts in our mind. The final mini-project, Rice-rocks, was very fun to program and to play. I hope that many other people will consider and take this class. It is definitely worth it.

                    Very simple material, but well-designed introduction to coding.  CodeSkulptor framework and programming assignment templates make creating pretty games simple by the end of week 8.  Code Clinics help with programming roadblocks (if any).  Discussion forums promote continued tinkering with the projects beyond minimum requirements.  Appropriate for ages 10+ (with parental support to meet deadlines and handle small amounts of frustration.)

Even though I didn't take it to 'learn' python since I already am working professionally, it did give me a lot of ideas in terms of explaining concepts to more junior members. That covers the professional aspect. The other part - the fun part - is that I enjoyed the videos and the way Python was taught. The projects were great and funny and I had overall a good time .

                    Great course. But I think you should have some programming experience in advance. The pace is high if you have other obligations such as a normal job. It is good to have access to a text-book covering Python when you take this class. There are several for free on the internet.

                    It was a very good class, especially the organization of the content. I have previously followed other courses on python (mostly basic) and gaming (still basic) in other languages. So far this was the most well presented introduction to game programming I have seen. The concepts are presented in a simple way, the provided tool (CodeSkulptor) is easy to use, and the provided task projects were interesting enough to keep me going week after week. The instructor were very knowledgeable on the subject of python (and gaming for that matter) and presented the material in such a way that I was not bored.

This is the highlight of this course, CodeSkulptor really helped in making sure everyone is using the same python version, saving the python scripts to could made it real easy to manage the files.

                    Because the course content is designed to engage programmers of various skill levels and programming language knowledge, content begins VERY simple concepts but gains momentum during the first course and presents greater challenge and complexity during the second course. Early in the course I was a bit concerned but realized around week 3 of the first course that the content would be stimulating and challenging. The real challenge came with the introduction and implementation of Object Oriented Programming. As a conventional programmer having learned to write in BASIC and Assembly code on the Commodore 64 and TI-99/4A this was a much needed exercise in changing my thought process and approach to programming. With a lot of work, watching the videos, interacting in the course discussions, use of code clinic, and looking at supplemental content, I actually understand and can implement OOP. What is unique is that they make what might otherwise seem to be dull material very fun by teaching the concepts from the perspective of designing classic games.
The instructors are, by far, the most engaging and thoughtful of any MOOC I have taken. I was impressed by the incredible amount of work they put into preparing the course. Saying they have gone above-and-beyond is an understatement. The video lectures are engaging. The creation of an online Python shell with easy to use built-in documentation clearly took an incredible amount of time. The end result is an easy-to-use IDE that allows participants to not only write code (and analyze it step-by-step through the use of Viz Mode), but to share and analyze others code by the simple sharing of a link. I was impressed by Dr. Warren's personal attention that he gives in the forums.
Overall I found the instructors to be thoughtful, engaging, humorous, and interested in students learning the material. They have accomplished creating a learning environment that is fun and fosters continuing even when the material gets challenging. I have not seen this from any other course I have taken.

                    I really enjoyed this class. I looked forward every week to the next video. I couldn't skip ahead like in other classes but it was fine. I did have prior Python experience from other MOOCs and that helped. The instructors were good at visually explaining each concept. I recommend dissecting each example they give you. The quizzes were tougher than I expected and if I didn't have the prior Python knowledge I could see the Mini-Projects taking longer than you'd expect. Even with what I knew I had to refer to the videos several times. In the end, I feel way more comfortable with Python. I'm sad this course isn't longer.

I also  think this course gives solid understanding about what programming is. Also I think it's easier to start programming with Python. I've tried to learn programming on C# and Visual Basic but these languagies is not so good for beginners.

                    Provider: Coursera works really well even if I had some problems getting them accepting my ID format and spent some day tinkering with the tech support when I was waiting to obtain my course certificate at the end of part I. The course is simply great: I think that everyone, from beginners to programmers that what to approach python in a fun way, will appreciate it. Videos are always nice: easy to follow but never boring, quizzes help fixing the concepts encouraging to try out things and mini projects with games to be implemented are super. The guides to develop them are really useful   and help novices with step by step suggestions. All the instructors are fantastic and I agree that we need to see more of John and code style / programming tips videos! I keep suggesting people to try out this course because I strongly believe that it would be useful and fun in many different occasions.

                    Both parts of this course were amazing. I work in a psychology lab where we use python-programmed experiments. I took other python courses to better understand this experiments but it was this one that helped me out the most. The other courses I took were not interactive; they just taught you how to use python to read files and that kind of stuff. This was so different and, in my opinion, so much better. I really leaned A LOT in mere two months, and the teachers are all great. Not only are they crystal clear when explaining, but they also make the class very entertaining. The mini-projects are engaging to complete, and you really feel satisfied when you get them done.
I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about programming.

                    This was a great course on introductory programming! I honestly wish some of my college courses were as well constructed. Every part of it worked together to teach new concepts without forgetting to reinforce and extent the older ones. All the videos were direct and on-point for the concepts you'd need for the week's project; the quizzes kept you very honest about your class video watching and highlighted the finer points of the concepts you'd need for the big homework project for the week. The focus on making those projects small games of increasing complexity but simple game play was spot-on too - both fun and rewarding on a regular basis. Even the grading scheme - where you run through several of your classmates' assignments and grade to criteria, was a clever way to have group participation without the typical problems of group work. And the CodeSculptor web-based Python development environment eliminated just about all the computer/OS specific problems. WELL DONE!!

One thing that seemed to be a negative was the work depended on the SimpleGUI libraries, which are not otherwise available outside CodeSkulptor which leaves your games stuck there - but since then I've read about SimpleGUICS2Pygame which should help in breaking your games free.

Also, while it is not meant as a comprehensive course on Python, it seemed that some concepts were too quickly introduced and put to use before understanding them and why they exist - Classes/OOP stands out. Also, sooo much dad humor...

But - for an introduction - my appetite is whet, and I'm off to see what else is out there. Well done to Joe, Rick, John, Stephen and Rice on University for making a great MOOC.

                    This class provides an environment where learning can occur at a reasonable pace.  The videos are short enough to be viewed in spare moments, the assignments are focused on one or two key topics at a time, and the progression is gradual enough to let students absorb the material and keep up week to week.  There are plenty of exercises with solutions to help understand the topics.  CodeSkulptor is a nice build environment, that puts users on many different systems on common ground.

                    What a great course!

By ""great"" I do *not* mean ""easy"".

As someone who has dabbled in programming, I found part two VERY difficult.  Object-oriented programming is a brand new concept to me, and quite challenging.  I plan to take part two again and see if I can pick up a more solid understanding.

This course is very well designed, with program templates and cool projects and exercises that I enjoyed.  AND it's free.  What have you got to lose?

                    In only 9 weeks, you'll go from pretty basic/introductory material to having the confidence (if not yet the high level expertise) to design and to code fairly complex, interactive (i.e., event-driven), object-oriented programs. And you'll have been taught in a very well thought out and 'layered' way which will have you internalising a lot of the material without you realising it (until you come to code something later and surprise yourself how easily you're doing it), and also experiencing just how much simpler and easier things can be with the object-oriented approach.  There are a few times towards the latter part of the the course where you can experience how relatively small amounts of programming with classes/objects leads to relatively powerful effects. (This course was my first exposure to OOP, so that was my experience having become very comfortable with procedural, non-OOP programming in the past.)
The instructors/lecturers are highly likeable, and are clearly very invested in the quality of the course. And one thing that's important to point out is that they have provided a substantial amount of support material: weekly 'concepts' go over the material taught in detail with plenty of examples; and weekly practice exercises that are pretty easy, and yet very helpful in cementing your knowledge and building up your coding confidence. The tools provided - CodeSkulptor for coding in your browser without having to download and install complex software, and ""Viz Mode"", for studying in detail what's going on in the bit of code you just wrote that isn't working as you expected it to - are just superb and well documented. CodeSkulptor in particular just makes it easy to get going in the course (and also helps to make peer reviewing much easier), and the Viz Mode - while I didn't use it much - is VERY helpful for gaining an understanding of what is going on 'under the hood' of Python (e.g., how lists are mutated, how local variables 'disappear' after a function has returned, etc., etc.) I could go on for longer, but if you are (like I was just before I started this) interested in learning a powerful, widely-used programming language within the context of a larger specialisation that is designed to teach the core concepts of computer science (this course if the first part of the 'Fundamentals of Computing' Coursera specialisation, then just enroll on the next course, and definitely sign up for certification if you can afford it, because that will help you to get all of your assignments in by the deadlines and to finish this great course!

                    I came from a non-programming background. I had some experience with SAS and SQL, but this is the second ""real"" programming course I have ever taken.

Things I like:
The contents are well-structured in an interesting manner. Instead of tedious long lectures on types of variables, mathematical crises or Turing machine you are actually building your knowledge from making games in this class. The course is friendly to newbies like myself, but it also gets deeper and systematic along the way. 

Joe and Scott are fantastic lecturers. The lectures are clear, well-paced and relaxed.

The forum is very helpful with many members active and willing to lend a hand. The peer review is a good process to learn from other peoples' work.

The only thing I don't like:
The last project was too difficult in terms of math and some notions are ambiguous in the lecture. For instance the fraction should be a constant and should always be in the opposite direction with the moving direction (which is not necessarily the same as the current direction of the ship). I saw a lot of people directly using the ship's direction to calculate the fraction, which is not correct. These calculations should be provided so people do not have to spend hours solving problems on maths and physics. This is a programming class after all :)

To conclude, I strongly recommend this class to whoever begins to learn programming or has some background in other languages but wants to learn python.

Thanks to everyone who brought this awesome course alive.

                    The content was well prepared, delivered with enthusiasm and personality and somehow managed to be engaging and worthwhile yet accessible to the huge breadth of learner experience watching.  Remarks made were clear to beginners yet concise and succinct enough for refresher students too.  e.g. in my case learning Python GUI from a background of compiled languages.

The instructor team are clearly committed to making this a positive, useful, empowering and beneficial experience for *every* learner.  They clearly want everyone to succeed. And to that end they've clearly invested much time in developing and polishing this 4/5th iteration of this course. When you add to that their boundless enthusiasm, Python-esque zany humour (and choice of t-shirts and ties), the team really does ""give it all"" for the thousands of students taking this course.

As to RICE University, I can only congratulate them for their insight that developing solid MOOC offerings is time well spent and this course is an excellent example of what can be done migrating classroom experience to the global MOOC platform.  Well done supporting your own people and in turn potentially hundreds of thousands of future learners.

As an experienced software developer who took a long career diversion into first aid and emergency care, this has been an enjoyable and productive way to get my head back into Computer science and coding, as well as apply that knowledge in a fun way - that of building well known graphical games.  Many Thanks to the RICE CS Team!!!

Probably the reason that I could manage finishing this course were the quality which was really great and that I could see their tremendous effort on it. I was really interested in taking it as if I sat in their lectures and enjoyed their conversations.  Besides that, the software used in the course 'CodeSkulpter' was really fantastic, which was easy to deal with.  Great Course!! Highly recommended.

                    Great course. Suitable for people new to programming, as well as people who have some programming exposure but are new to Python. There are weekly multi-choice quizzes that have intelligent questions to make you think about the concepts taught. The weekly mini-projects are challenging and interesting.

                    Learning Python from a game-making perspective (as opposed to say scientific routine perspective) is effective and fun.  The course is well thought out in that the student is encouraged to advance with plenty of support for any stumbles along the way.  Nicely done, professors.

                    I've finished both parts of this class and I really want to thank Joe, Scott, John and Stephen (hey, I thought I'd see him at least once! :)). 
I took this course because I want to start data science specialisation in the university (my major specialisation is a manager, this is an extra-course to choose). It includes 4 disciplines and starts with learning Python. I found it really interesting, but I was a pretty average student in programming classes and school, and I was afraid that I won't be smart enough for taking this class. This is why I decided to start learning Python in advance, in summer (the specialisation started in autumn). I never thought that, first of all, it would be SO interesting for me to learn Python, and second of all, that I will manage to learn it. But I did! And I wouldn't do that if these great teachers weren't there to teach, if stuff and other students weren't there to help. I loved that you explained everything in an easy way, I loved your fun mini-projects! And I've been studying Python in my university for a month, and this goes so much easier that it could have been without your help. Though there are lots of things I need to learn and I find out about new functions and methods (well, there are many new things because the direction of our university class is different, and that means learning new specific features), it goes very smoothly, and it's not just because this course gave me the essential basics of Python, it's also because I became so much confident and thanks to Coursera and this course, I know that I can be pretty good at programming.

                    There is no doubt course is very well organized and gives a good start to beginners. Hats off to both Scott, John for their crisp teaching style and the amount of hard work they have put in. However, I completed with a feeling that a lot of different aspects have not been covered. Course is focused only on GUI oriented programming. Even though personally, GUI aspects were interesting to me as I never worked on GUI before and got a good incite into it. There are many different aspects like networking, file operations, multi-threading, IPC etc. which were not touched upon. There are probably more advanced courses to cover those. Thanks a lot for giving me chance to learn.

                    Loved everything about this class. Professors Rixner and Warren, the two leads, explain concepts clearly and in a way that builds logically. They really seem to understand how we learn. They also seem to really enjoy teaching, and working with each other. It sounds funny but it made me feel good to watch their interactions.

In terms of what I learned--I cannot believe I was able to complete an asteroids game in 8 weeks. They provide you with a very structured sequence of steps that make it possible to do what seems like an impossibility at first. 

Finally, as woman who likely is about the same age as the instructors--when I think back to when I was in college, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be able to learn to program in my 40's! So thank you all, for giving me the confidence that I can do this.

I've had the great fortune of obtaining college and graduate degrees at wonderful institutions where brilliant thinkers who also happened to be master teachers were the norm. My experience with this Python class was similar to those.

The video lectures, practice exercises, quizzes, and mini-projects were laid out meticulously and in an appropriate manner. The class was very challenging for me, but I found that they provided all the materials I needed if I was willing to put in the time and effort. If you are just casually observing this class, it might not seem as incredible; I'd recommend you take this class if you seriously are motivated to learn and think through the various puzzles they present each week.

Both the instructors were great. They were intelligent, coherent, funny, and they put their best efforts into the class.
Coursera is a great site. its very easy to use, very user friendly, and the variety of classes is very very big.

                    I went from never programmed at all (in any language), to programming a game that my husband likes to play. This is seriously amazing.

This is probably one of the best designed and well structured courses I've ever taken, and I seriously recommend to everyone who would like to try programming in Python. You can rest assured that the skills you need to complete the assignments are in the classes, and if you have any trouble you can also rely on the forum.

This course is incredibly fun and it gives you an amazing sense of empowerment and accomplishment.

This course is not just a platform for students to learn programming but also an inspiration that continuously encourages me to look beyond the syllabus and try on my own. I guess this is really the core value of this course that introduces an easy and powerful programming language and builds up your interest towards programming over the duration of the class.

                    An outstanding course!! The best course I have ever taken - Coursera or not! The absolute goal of the instructors was to help students to learn! every question on the quiz was aiming at helping with mini-projects! it was obvious there was a lot of time put in in structuring this course -- they were so many excellent components of it -- the Concepts and Examples section, the Programming Tips videos, the TA suppot, the You Tube videos, the Code Clinic!!! I have raved about this course to my all friends, family and co-workers! I felt sad when the course was over! Never felt anything about any of my classes before! It would be fair to mention TAs -- they were extremely helpful!! and seemed like they were constantly online, always ready to help! 

Every little detail of this course was designed to made the learning fun!! IF there is a thing such a best instructor's award, these instructors should have it!!

Learning a new language through designing games! How brilliant is that?

                    Tremendous work behind the scenes to teach Python and OOP programming with the intent of fun through writing games through a special GUI to deploy games guided carefully through projects.
An excellent to kick-off programming and to learn about the power of Python; complete with handy docs and error debugging sections.

The class started off very simple and progressed at a good pace, not too easy, but not impossibly hard.  Some projects were challenging, but in a good way and there was plenty of support through the practice problems, TA supplied videos and the class discussion.  The instructors were excellent and funny and the projects were fun.  I would definitely recommend this course!

                    Creo que fue un fallo enorme, por lo menos para mí, el hecho de que algunos vídeos no estuvieran subtitulados para el español.

                    It is a very well organized course. Scott and Joe are great instructors; they teach you valuable concepts and make you laugh in every other lectures. 
It took me about 10-12 hours/week for the course as am new to python. The mini-projects may seem daunting at first; however the course material, video lectures and practice examples are comprehensive enough to not to make you feel novice. The discussion forums were very helpful too. All my doubts were already discussed and solved in it, so I never had to post anything. Great course and great experience altogether.

                    I love Coursera and I was developing a tool at work so I decided to start learning Python and develop it with Python. This course covers some problems I get. The only thing I see is that the course has to deal with many different student's levels so sometimes it goes too slow if you already have programming knowledge. But you get fun doing it!

                    I can't imagine a better starting point for new programmers. The course set-up and the brilliance of CodeSkulptor (including the documentation and the visualisation tools) removes many of the typical obstacles to programming (computer literacy, math knowledge). Of course, the astute student will have to dig deeper into those issues, but that is beyond the scope of the course. The instructors are especially great and have made a well though-through transition to the MOOC world.

The lectures are interesting to watch, not boring at all, the mini-projects are challenging for beginners, more experienced programmers may find them a little bit too easy. But as the course says, it's only an introduction. Full 5 stars in each category, and looking forward to see more courses from these teachers and Rice University.

                    This is an excellent introduction to Python programming which gives you the opportunity to create some fun games. A bonus is that the programming environment runs in your browser which removes one of the major obstacles of similar courses which is the installation of a programming IDE.

Instructors were good at explaining what was going on and had a good sense of humor so material didn't seem dry and boring. Provider was good and easy to interact with instructors, other students and submit quiz answers and homework,

                    Good & entertaining introduction to Python. Great online help from both fellow-students and class-staff. Quick responses help you out when you get stuck (and I got stuck quite a few times as a beginning programmer). Last resort is an e-mail ""hotline"" that I needed for the end project, great thing that they provided this. Coursera to me is a great learning-platform because of the deadlines, the simultanious learning with a large community and the variation in learning material: videos, quizzes and projects.

                    An awesome and committed set of teachers and a strong  community are just the tip of the iceberg of this very well structured, engaging and challenging course . I just finished Part II but I think I do not realize as of yet how much I have learned, not only about programming in Python but also about time management, how to structure a project, division of tasks and self motivation.

Give it a Try!

                    The course is really well-prepared. The only thing I'd suggest is to add a final mini-project that doesn't have so detailed instructions or program template. Such a way, a student has to think about how to organize handlers, classes, functions etc. I mean he starts  a new program from zero.

                    This course is a great way to get into programming if you have never done it before.  It is also great for programmers who use other programming languages to get a handle on Python.
The lecturers and content are clear and easily followed.  The weekly assignments are a challenge and if you finish them you have a feeling of satisfaction.

                    I am a statistician who has been using a variety of languages to code for many years.  I am interested in learning Python and I took this class for a quick introduction into the subject.  As expected I found the class easy given my background.  What I did not expect was the high quality of the teaching, quizzes and projects.  The instructors have put a truly excellent course together making the introduction to python fun.  I really did have fun building the games and in the process can write Python code.  I would also like to say that their CodeScultptor IDE is awesome (along with their simpleGUI package).  I could have easily picked this stuff up by reading a book, but this was fun and the instructors are excellent.  I highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to learn Python either as another or a first language.

                    I had gone through 2 Python books and thought I had a bit of a grasp of programming but also knew I had zero confidence of completing even a small project on my own. I tried a couple different online courses and didn't find they helped much more. The Python course from Rice University on Coursera is awesome! I was pushed every week but the videos are awesome! The lecturers give a 100%. The other students in the forum are awesome! By far the best way I've found to learn programming. As an educator myself it is truly inspirational. Do the course!!

                    Coursera provides a platform for learning a broad area of interests.  The basic classroom model includes video lectures, discussion forums, automated grading, student grading, and more.  Many classes are free, or a certificate can be had for a nominal fee.  Other classes or specializations, a set of classes, may have a somewhat higher associated cost, but nothing approaching even my local community college rates.
Programming in Python provides a challenging, beginner level of instruction.  The carrot (caret?) at the end is a game similar to Asteroids that they affectionately call RiceRocks, as this class is provided by Rice University.  The primary instructors, Joe Warren and Scott Rixner, provide friendly, informed lectures, lots of assistance through the forums, and generally have an entertaining teaching style that shows their enthusiasm for the material.  I highly recommend the class.

Very powerful course that takes you from an absolute beginner to an upper-intermediate level. This course teaches you all you need in procedural programming, event-driven and object oriented programming in a matter of weeks. 
What makes this course so unique is the CodeSkulptor tool that eases the difficulties of installing any software to get things ready to program.
I love the support I got from the lecturers and from classmates.

                    I knew a thing or two about programming in Python before this class so I can say that the instructors did a good job in delivering knowledge I already had, as well as concepts that were new to me. Video-lectures were fun and well structured, quizzes did an excellent job at testing the our knowledge, and the Mini-projects are a terrific way to test our new skills. The Forum and he Code Clinic are great places if you're stuck and need help. Scott Rixner and Joe Warren are great teachers, and CodeSculptor is a great tool for people who are new to programming. VizMode is a great debugging tool, and although I didn't use it often, I think it's great for new programmes. John Greiner's ""Programming tips"" videos were very helpful, as were his instruction on how to use VizMode. Coursera, as a provider, was stable and easy to use. I had a great time taking this course and it motivated me not only to continue learning new programming techniques, but to take other courses as well.

                    I think the most valuable and inspirational part of the course is the description of development process of each mini project. When I putting agile software development method to practice, Sometime it is not so obvious about how to plan tasks for a user story. Not only I want to get the user story done with the tasks I list out, but I also expect that when I run the sequence of tasks, I can easily test each of them, and the tests contribute to the final result. The way that the professors describe (and instruct us through) the development process of mini projects is a very good example for me.

                    A terrific intro to Python programming.

Rice University (Scott Rixner) has programmed a web interpreter for Python called CodeSkulptor that makes it really easy to experiment, try things out, and run your programs from any platform.  It can even function as a single-step emulator/debugger.

Combining the CodeSkulptor platform, with a series of interesting and progressive projects, and a good organization of the Python programming topics, you also get a group of Rice professors (Joe Warren, Scott, and John Greiner) who, while sometimes a bit geekish, really have fun teaching, and it's a pleasure learning from them.

Only downside - no text; my own notes are now my Python reference work.  (On the other hand, perhaps making me write, edit, and reorganize my own reference book helped me learn!)

                    Great course, well structured & clear. Impressive to see how you get to build quite an advanced game after only just 8 weeks. 

My original idea was to learn Python to get better at data analysis. This course goes a bit outside that scope, but it has only resulted in a deeper understanding of the language.

                    I really appreciate myself for taking this course,this really helped me  learning so much and understanding python.The structure of the course is really awesome!
Thoroughly enjoyed working on every single assignment.
The most interesting part of the course is doing peer assessment, by which we not only stick with one approach of implementing the code but only knows different ideas.Not to mention Codeskulptor.

Looking forward for more interesting courses on programming by Rice University and especially by these four awesome professors.

Thank you so much!

                    The course was extremely engaging, and really lots of fun. Each week the concepts are presented to you in the context of a game, which you will then go out and make. The games themselves range from memory, to pong, to blackjack, to asteroids, and are surprisingly fun to play after you've made them. Moreover, the instructors frame the making of each game within several reasonably straight forward steps, giving the programming of the games a gamelike feel themselves.

The other thing about this course that I found extremely valuable was the peer review system. Instead of having a machine grade your games, each student reviews the games of five other students, and grades them on the rubric. I learned quite a bit about proper design from playing other peoples' games, and graders have also often left useful comments on my own games.

                    The pacing of this class was perfect for a beginning programmer. I started with only a little knowledge of programming, and by the end of the class, I was enthusiastically forcing all my friends to play my awesome game! I had to work hard to get my assignments in on time, but it didn't kill me, even though I was working a full time job while taking it. The professors are funny, and explain things really well while also keeping the class interesting. I'm suggesting this class to all my friends who have ever expressed an interest in exploring programming. 

I also loved the way the class was structured. It was broken up into weeks, and each week was broken into two sections. Each section had a few lecture videos, and a quiz (which you could take multiple times, to make sure you really understand everything). Each week had a mini-project, where we made some little game to annoy our friends with. At the end of the course, I feel like I have a good set of stand-alone programs that I can brag about, and refer back to as I continue learning.

                    Excellent course to learn programming using Python (which is one of the most succinct programming languages). At the same time, the course has lots to offer for experienced programmers too. Kudos to the course staff for keeping things highly structured as we progressed into more complex topics.

                    I absolutely loved this class and I would and have recommended it for everyone who would like to learn computing and/or Python.  I am an experienced software developer (although new to Python and fairly new to Object Oriented development) and I found the material challenging.  The format of the class is very well thought out; Lecture, quizzes, and mini-project guide you toward learning the material on a weekly basis.  The instructors are superior and have worked very hard to engage the students.  They make the asynchronous Coursera format work.  This is the best class I took on Coursera and will continue to take the series in great part because of Scott and Joe.  Thank you.

They even developed a special platform for online programming, saving, and even visualizing code execution (code sculptor and viiz mode). Coursera is a decent course provider, but the team of Rice university are the best I saw in many related courses.

The mini-projects made me think a lot... helped me find out my own flaws in programming, and by evaluating other's work I am able to know different ways of coding for the same problem. --It will be good if the original answer to the mini-project is displayed after the hard-deadline, so that we may be able to learn even if we skipped an assignment--I love this course so much, that i have recommended this course to my friends too!!

Mini projects are very staightforward (may be too much?) and easy to do. The templates are great, only the fun part is left for us to do.
I actually had my first baby during this class, but still completed it, since  it is so fun. Highly recommend this class.

Maybe it would be a great idea to create a course about the scientific tools of python as SciPy, NumPy, SimPy, Matplotlib and others.

                    This class was amazing! The teachers were amazing, and I learned quite much from it. Before, I only knew the syntax of python from Codecademy, and I didn't know how to actually apply it to anything, but from here, I learned many valuable tools from which I can now expend on to actually make some programs I wish to make. This course was truly a gateway to real programming from what I only knew as syntax.

The instructors were kind and I really enjoyed how they tried to engage their students with some humor in their video (of course, humors are not the focus of their video) and they really do know how to teach! I loved the lesson pace, and I really encourage any programming beginner to take this class because the lessons were well organized and compare to other course I took (as little as they are) this class's materials were concise and to the point, enabling their student to make really fun program and make them feel proud of themselves for their new accomplishment in rather short time.

                    I was new to python and I must say at the end of this course you will feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment and you can also brag to your friends who didnt take this course about the games you built and they will like ""what!? you built that? "".
However this is not the only course I recommend you to take if you want to learn python. You may need additional courses if you want to master this language. Well the name of the course does say ''Introduction'' so you get the point I am trying to make. People from non programming background might find this course a little tricky. But if you put the right amount of hard work, I am sure you can pass this course.

                    This is probably the best MOOC I've taken (and I've taken quite a handful). The organization and content are impressive, from the lectures to the quizzes and projects and all the tools they have for this course. I knew they were effective because I was surprised how much I actually learned after completing the course. The instructors have a way of keeping you engaged; I never found myself bored with this class. They keep it light, concise, and believe it or not, fun. You can tell that the instructors are really invested in this course. They seem very happy to be teaching the course and that energy is contagious.

                    If only all learning could be this much fun ! Build classic games while learning to program using Python - how can it get better than this ?
The lectures are a lot of fun and the instructors explain the concepts very clearly. There are good examples given and you can do practice exercises to drill in the knowledge.
The course does demand a fair bit of time each week, but the lectures are short and informative, the quizzes are detailed and complete and require a bit of extra programming and the mini-project and peer reviews require a few hours of extra effort. But the results are amazing and time will be well spent. Each mini-project comes with a lot of assistance to help you complete the task. And another bonus, no installations or configurations required, run everything right in your browser.
Truly amazing and highly recommended for all ages.

                    The instructors for this class are very enthusiastic about programming, and are great at explaining programming concepts to beginning programmers.  It's a great introduction class. One part that was difficult for me was the math involved. You definitely need to be familiar with some basic trigonometry, so if it's been a while, you might want to brush up on it a bit first.

I believe it is a great place to start programming, although it would definitely demand a few hours of your time each week.

                    I liked that the video lectures were broken into individual topics, this made it easy to go back and re-watch a specific part that I needed to review for the weekly quiz or project.  The programming tips lectures were helpful in going beyond the basic how-tos and teaching better practices. The projects were fun and I liked the peer review process for evaluating them.  Having a development process already written and a code template for the projects made them easy to complete, although I did already have programming experience. I feel like I have a good enough handle on GUI programming with Python now to move on to my own projects.

                    This is an excellent course, and I highly recommend it to ANYONE that wants to learn Python or just get better at Python programming.  It covers Python from the ground up.  I’ve programmed in Python for several years and still learned a lot.  I took the course because I knew I had gaps in my understanding of Python.  I particularly appreciated the part on OOP (object-oriented programming).  It is something that I used before, but did not really understand until I took this course.

You learn Python by building games using a web-based version of Python developed specifically for the course called CodeSkulptor.  At first, I wasn’t sure about using CodeSkulptor, but it was a good choice.  It removes the struggle of just trying to get Python to work on your machine that can wear you out before you even begin.  Building the games was fun, and when you get a game to work correctly, you want to do back-flips.

They also have a Code Clinic where you can send your code when you are having problems.  I used it a couple of times and found it invaluable.  They responded quickly and were very helpful.

                    Course Content is very well organized. But this is more of beginner level course for Python. So for people already familiar with programming this might be not challenging at times. However the amount of effort needed is no less. 
The help pages and the forums are really well managed.
Instructors are the best part of this course and you will really enjoy listening to them. Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and John Greiner. Thank You for putting this course together.

                    I took this class as I was interested in learning Python. The instructors were awesome! They kept the class really fun and we built games for the mini-projects that slowly increased in the difficulty. That kept me going back to take the class every time a new class video & mini project was posted. If not for the puns and healthy rivalry between the instructors, I would've enjoyed the class lesser. I would recommend this class to any person who is interested in learning programming! Hail Sir Loin!!!

                    Before jumping into An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, offered by Rice University, I was attempting to learn Python on my own.  I was not happy with how my progress was going, I couldn't see the big picture.  That all changed with the way Joe Warren and Scott Rixner presented the pertinent information, while giving glimpses of it's larger context.  While challenging, the class is easily manageable if you short on time and are determined to understand the material.  

The mode of learning how to program through creating games is a huge boon to most types of people.  I feel this is because you can immediately present and show off what you've accomplished to give yourself a morale boost and continue on after a hard week of struggling through concepts that are presented.

I would highly recommend this course for beginners, novices, and really all levels of programming understanding.  There's so much to add to your programs, even after you've finished the assignments.  Just remember to turn them in on time!  I may have missed the deadline twice even though I finished days before it was due. oops!

                    Life changing class. Went from zero programming knowledge to making multiple games. Teachers were great and explained the material really well. The mini-projects and quizzes helped solidify each new topic for the week.  Spent about 10-15 hours a week on this class. However, if you want to improve your programming skills, you should do other things in addition to this class like get good python books. I recommend Invent Games with Python.

                    I think it is one of the best courses on python for beginners. The best thing about it that you have practical application of what you have learned, not just theory and boring tasks not leading anywhere, but games fun to play.

                    Whether you already have some programming experience in another language and want to learn Python, or if you have no experience at all and want to dive into programming, I would highly recommend taking this course. The material covered is extensive but not too complex, so it is a great primer into programming in Python, and leaves you at a comfortable point to be able to expand your knowledge and skills independently. The instructors are great. They are knowledgeable, eloquent, helpful and fun. The course is organized well and includes lots of resources to help you through to completion and beyond.

                    For a beginner who has some basic understanding of Python like syntax, data types and a bit of looping. This is the go to course.It shows various aspects of programming in a fun and challenging way. It really makes you work hard and in the end you will be amazed with what you can do .This course is a great introduction to Python. But if you are a complete novice I would recommend doing Codecademy's python course and even a bit of reading of How To Think Like A  Computer Scientist beforehand. A background in programming will surely help . But otherwise this course is a great option for anyone looking for an introduction to Python. The teachers are amazing and even the discussion forums and support groups are really helpful.So even if you are stuck there is plenty of help available.Not many courses give joy but this one surely does! So go ahead and take this course. You will not regret it.

                    This was a great set of classes. I'd recommend this class to anyone at any level of programming experience who wants to get a good introduction to Python.

I have over 30 years of development experience, but have never coded Python before. Even though this class was geared to student with little to no programming experience, the programming assignments and quizzes were still challenging enough to keep me busy on the weekends :) 

Fortunately, the class was a also lot of fun. Spending hours doing game development is a lot more fun than building esoteric applications. It's also more rewarding to play games that you've built yourself, rather than something you just downloaded from the web.

I also can't speak highly enough of the class curriculum, the instructors, and the individual course content. Usually, each week's lectures and the explanation of the accompanying project assignment would be split among the 3 main instructors, each providing a different area of focus and expertise - Python Language, Data Structures, Game Mechanics , Best Practices, and Debugging. I think the delegation of these tasks made the class more interesting, since it allowed each instructor to focus on part of the course they were most enthusiastic about teaching. The best part was that you could tell that the instructors (at least 2 of them :)  ) had fun teaching these classes!

                    The content was very understandable and always came with practice excersises to better understand it.
The projects we had to do were explained in detail and were as hard (and as ""easy"") as they should.
The instructors were funny, I LOVED them. Definitely will enroll to other courses they teach.
Thank you for this beautiful journey. I'll miss you Joe and Scott!

                    I am 55 and my only programming experience was in college with punch cards.  I had no intention to start a career in CS, but wanted to do it for fun.  This class was perfect.  It was well laid out, well taught and since the projects are based on building games, fun.  After taking Python I and II,  I am continuing on to take the rest of the courses from Rice University.  I am hooked.  I also signed up for the signature track just to compensate everyone involved.  I believe good work should be rewarded.  The $49.00 is well worth it.  Even though I am a novice, many students are very experienced and find the course worthwhile.  I highly recommend this course to anyone.

                    The content is extremely stimulating. The videos are broken into manageable segments (never more than 15 straight minutes) and the quizzes actually require some testing to get them right. But the great thing about this course is the project section. All the games you create are fun, fruitful and help you learn something new every time. You get a unique feeling of accomplishment when you finish each assignment. All the instructors of the course are really dedicated to the course and try to present the things you need in the simplest possible way. The course is hosted in Coursera, with whom I have had great experience so far.

                    The course is very well build and all aspects of learning are incorporated. You receive study material as video lectures. There is about 5-8 video clips per week, each is no longer than 15 min, usually around 10.  Clips are very easy to understand, with little bit of humor and just the right length to stay focus for the whole time.  You required to completed a quiz each week (usually 2 parts about 8 question in each part), which helps with preparation for the mini-project of the week and to understand the lectures better. Mini-project takes the most (at least for me with zero programming experience) time. Overall I would highly recommend this course for python beginners.

I'm already a software engineer using C/C++, and web stuff, and I really enjoyed this course
I recommend this course to anyone.

It does not require maths, or any prior experience in programming, thus it is very doable even for people who do not consider themselves good in any of these things. For people who do have experience in programming and have a good understanding of maths, the same instructors are doing more advanced courses. 

All in all, great experience and no regrets about taking the course.

                    Well, I have to say, this is one of the best courses I have taken from Coursera. Joe and Scott are good professors, and more importantly, really nice lecturers. The materials are well documented, the lectures are well organized, the mini projects are carefully set so the students can learn something and at the meanwhile don't feel boring. I highly recommend who are new to python to take this course.

I highly recommend this course to those who don't even have any programming experience. It will be right course for you. There's so many help everywhere: good explanation in video lectures, hints in quizzes, very detailed instructions in mini-projects and good examples in Practice Exercises section. 

Thanks again to the instructors: Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong. And also to the Rice University for providing such course!

                    Absolutely excellent introduction to programming, event driven design and Object orientated programming. 
Instructors Joe, Scott and John are very good teachers, taking it slowly and explaining in full.
To me the main assets of the course were:
-use of the online codeskulptor for development and 'simplegui'
-Weekly mini projects and two quizzes. Really had to think! which is great as its the only way to learn programming is to program.
-Structure of the course. Started slowly and each week builds on the last. very good pace to learn.
-Peer review. I thought i wouldn't like this, i had to mark 5 other peoples min-projects. Thought it would be a waste of time, but it wasn't. Really interesting to see how other people think and i picked up many ideas and good style/s.

I would definitely taken this course again.

                    The course covered Python in a fun way. Each lecture series building on the previous series.  The programming assignments were challenging but rewarding in that you get to ""play"" with the final games your create and share them with friends.

                    ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"" offered by Rice University via Coursera is one of the best programming courses I have come across as a student. The content is fantastic, the teacher are awesome. Both Joe Warren, and Scott Rixner offer invaluable insight into event-driven programming using Python. Hats off to them. John's programming tips are one of its kind, it will raise your level of programming for sure. The class is fun, the games that we've built in the course are enjoyable. I would recommend any one interested in programming to take this class, you won't regret the experience.

                    As a total beginner I'm glad I took Coursera's ""Programming for Everybody"" first; the pace of this class is much faster and it helped to have the basics down. I found the 2nd part of the class difficult but overall a lot of fun. I enjoyed the instructors, the projects and the community was very helpful. If you are new to programming and put in the time you will learn quite a bit about programming and Python while having fun creating games. RiceRocks!

                    Excellent class.  I think both the content and structure were very well thought out.  I especially liked how the concepts were used in the mini-programming projects writing games.  I have a son in 4th grade and we both had a lot of fun tweaking the various parameters for the games to change colors, speed, etc. for parts of each project.  I'm not sure if it inspired him to want to program but I sure had a lot of fun and think I learned a great deal in the process.

                    This course is extraordinary. The instructors from Rice University built an own Python coding platform (codeskulptor.org) that really helps writing and submitting the weekly projects. The course material is very on-the-point. As the programming projects consist of small games every week (Pong and Asteroids among them), the motivation to test them is pretty high.
The class does take some work each week and some people on the forums mentioned some trouble - however the instructors even have a sub-forum called ""code clinic"" where they review ""broken"" code and support when necessary.

I recommend this class for everyone looking to start programming in Python who can invest the 5-7 hours a week. (Skipping a week might lead to some frustrations I suppose, as the material buils upon itself).

                    A really interesting and fun way to learn about coding, with the ability to use your code and share the result with friends who might know nothing about coding. Being able to code simple games made it very rewarding. Instructors really work hard to make it enjoyable and the discussion forums are excellent. As someone with very little coding experience, I found this class quite challenging and spent longer than the approximated time in the later part of the course on each code. Although at times I felt like banging my head against a brick wall, with the tools provided you can eventually work out the solution (might just take a long time) and it is incredibly rewarding once you finally get your games to work.

You should take this course if you want to improve your programming skills. Knowledges about programming are not required but it's useful.

However I think the content is too focused on SimpleGUI and you spend a lot of time trying to understand the API that won't use anymore.

                    I am a beginner program. Overall I found the course to be very challenging, however I successfully completed all of the quizzes and mini-projects. I feel great satisfaction upon completing the course and have gained skills that I plan to continue to use.

The weekly videos, practice exercises, quizzes, and mini-projects worked well together. The videos of the instructors were excellent.

The course forum was invaluable for learning. I hope to continue collaborating with those same programmers.

                    To me it was an awesome experience. I have had some experience in c programming, yet completely new in Python. Being able to do interactive programming just as a beginner was a great joy, which is only possible within Codeskulptor. 

I am happy with the structure of the course as well as its organisation. They schedule the course in a way that I only spent my weekends on it. So it does not interfere with my PhD process.

Joe and Scott were great instructors. I guess they don't assume anything any prior knowledge and try to explain everything from the scratch. I hope others manage to take the course and enjoy programming in python.

                    TL;DR provided

I can't tell you whether the provider (Coursera) was meant for them or they (Rice University) was meant for them, it just works together that well.  
I have completed part 1 and part 2 of this course having no programming experience or education to begin with. I can now competently write my own simple to intermediate level programs in Python. I recently took a look at several other languages to see where I would like to go after I complete the Fundamentals of Computer Science specialization. I can say that just going through these courses has opened my eyes to understanding other programming languages. Of course I would need to learn them, but there is enough similarity that I can comprehend their basics much easier. I'm glad that I decided to go with Python and these courses first.  
I went through the signature track. Signing up for it was easy. If you don't have the money to pay, Coursera offers financial aid that's easy to apply for, just look for the small link at the bottom of the payment page. 
The courses seemed like they were going slow for the first few weeks, but then it quickly ramped up in pace to moderate/moderate fast. With this in mind, DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. They will make life easier in the long run, it's why they are there. Some of them seem like they may be repeats, but are slightly dissimilar aimed to give more practice on important things later or gives another underlying concept. There's plenty of help in the forums from classmates, TA's, and the instructors. The instructors are active on the forums, they didn't make the videos and leave. 
The audio level from the videos are more consistent then other programming courses I looked at during this course. There are a few times where it got a little quieter, mostly when they were using pip and running code. On my quiet laptop I can hear just fine unless the tv or a nearby fan is on. There's no major fluctuations so all was well for me chromecasting it to the tv and turning it up or just moving away from the fan a little.  
The class is using Python 2.6 in a custom built interface called codeskulptor. Documentation is exceptional and focused. They use a module called simplegui as there GUI creator. It really helps to simplify some things so you can focus on learning how's and whys of programming.  
Some differences between simplegui and pythons built-in GUI called tkinter.  
In tkinter you would create a window, then create a frame, then place the frame in the window, then create a canvas, then place the canvas.  
In simplegui they combined the create and placement into one call combining the basic elements you would usually initialize for most of the projects. You would then also create and place a button or label with one call instead of two, making it less verbose.  
You may fall in love with the simplicity of simplegui and want to keep using it on your own. But let me tell you that with it's simplicity it brings more limitations.
Don't worry about what version of python they use, their goal is creating a foundation of programming, and they do well at teaching this. I myself would practice the concepts using both version 2 and 3 and also tkinter because I was worried that I may be learning something that's not useful. It's not the case. Everything is transferable, in fact, there's just some minor differences between version 2 to 3 and simplegui to tkinter. One of the things you'll do is look some things up in the documentation they provide. It only takes a few minutes to do and understand by how concise they made it. This is another skill that you will need to learn for programming. In their documentation they also provide examples to the same skills in tkinter and a few other modules, I believe pygame was one. These extras in the documentation are not full, but show how you can ""convert"" your skills over easily.  
I highly recommend this class. It is thought out and honed in well. In fact, after taking this class, you'll likely have a python interpreter pinned to your taskbar and with every problem you'll click and in minutes type out a solution. You'll also likely view things around you in a different light because of the gained logic.  


TL;DR - All in all. They made it easy to learn Python and transferable programming skills. You just need to show up and do the practice problems.

                    The course is great introduction to the principles of programming. It gives me a lot of positive thoughts about solving interesting problems not just in basic issues of todays programming world but also in very interesting informations about game development.

The course is very fluent even every week and weekend there is bunch of things you have to do. 
I loved to solve mini-projects > the reasonable code with big game in the end.

Teachers were awesome. Every single info you need to pass this class they provided with easy to understand way.

Good one!

                    This is a great way to learn Python and you get a good introduction to Event-driven and Object Oriented Programming along the way. 

Their approach of getting the student to build increasingly sophisticated games for the weekly assignments is engaging and satisfying. 

The videos are fun to watch and cover everything you need to know to successfully complete the assignments. 

I would take another course with these instructors in a heartbeat. I really loved taking this course.

                    I appreciate the enthusiasm of the instructors. The pace of the class is way too intense, however, for the aspirations of the class in the amount of time given. I understand fully the sense of accomplishment that can come from a ""challenging"" class. However, it's important to balance this students don't feel frustrated and give up. This class may aspire to make programming accessible and fun to everyone, but at the moment, it's preaching to the choir.

                    A great introduction to Python.  What sets this course apart is the focus on fun - instructors are having fun, we build games, and we learn at the same time. Code is written in a simplified development environment, which removes all of the frustration I've experienced trying to get IDEs working for other courses.

                    CodeSkulptor is a great accomplishment for teaching, but it does have its bugs and limitations.   There are times (usually only hours, sometimes more) when it does not work.  Then you're doing battle with CodeSkulptor instead of learning Python, programming, or GUI programming.

Joe Warren and Scott RIxner were great teachers. They made the information understandable and the class lectures fun. Even those times when I felt overwhelmed with the content - the class lectures were enjoyable and kept me motivated. I found the material challenging - but not impossible. I had a great time watching the lectures, learning the code and programming  the games. I was left with a feeling of accomplishment.
I'd recommend this class to any beginner programmer.

                    Now I feel I'm getting into programming, and I'm really starting to understand the basics and mechanics involved in function structure, sinthaxis, etc.

Great course.

Keep that way and hope to see you at a further class soon this year! Jean-Marie from France

Very empathetic instructors, entertaining and interesting videos and material, highly professional structure with forums, TAs, code clinic, etc.   The special Python environment ""Codeskulptor' takes away fear as it takes all setting up issues away and allows you to achieve amazing results in the forms of cool games.

I am very proud of what I have been able to learn through this format in a short space of time.  You have to take your hats off to the Rice University guys who set a challengingly high bar and then get so many people to meet the challenge.  

This really seems to be the stand-out Python MOOC.

                    Excellent class for those that don't want to get bogged down in a bunch of details and theory and would rather get moving quickly. The course dives right into event-driven programming which makes for a superb complement to more typical, strictly-procedural introductory courses. I highly recommend this course for those looking to get started.

                    I think this course makes programming very accessible to people with little to no prior knowledge to programming at all. Personally I've had a tiny bit of prior experience from studying computer science in high school, mostly in C and a small bit in Assembler so I did have a small bit of prior knowledge.

Still I couldn't really write any meaningful programs just from my high school knowledge, whereas now after this course I have a solid toolbox to begin programming with. Also the weekly projects of the course were in and of themselves meaningful, such as programming the games: pong, memory and blackjack(albeit with simplistic rules) that I can now take and expand on to make them better with the knowledge of the entire course under my belt now.

Moreover I can envision how various popular games that I like playing were created, at least the programming portions of them(not the graphics, animations, etc), and think I have the tools to write similar games. I might not be able to write them in the most efficient way as I still lack programming experience but it's at least I can create a working code to achieve the same results. Higher efficiency will naturally come with experience.

                    Having been away from programming for 30 years I found this a very thorough way to pick it up again.  All the materials are top notch and Scott and Joe, the 2 principle lecturers are clear AND have a sense of humor.  So important.  The only warning I have is it took me a lot longer then 7 to 10 hours a week.  More like 30 hours a week in the last few projects.  I learned a lot.

                    The instructors, Joe and Scott are fantastic. This is a case of people really loving what they do, and teaching people about it. As a physics student I don't always find that in my professors, so it was a breath of fresh air to see how much dedication the professors that put this together have for teaching computer science.
I wouldn't call this course difficult, but it's certainly mentally stimulating (if you absolutely new to programing).

I would say that in this class you learn much faster than school, specially the subjects of events, classes and drawing. The projects developed in this course are very interesting, specially the final one: you applied some physics and math. I really recommend it.

                    This was an excellent introduction to interactive programming. The lectures were good, and the weekly projects were well thought out. In order to do things quickly, they have set up their own development environment that allows a beginner to easily put a GUI together with buttons and displays. I was surprised at how far we got in a short time.

                    The content and instructors were great. Scott and Joe are a quirky team that make each lesson fun and John's programming tips helped with a better understanding of certain concepts and working with CodeSkulptor's Viz mode for debugging. I felt that each topic was shown in enough detail to be easy to understand and work with without watering down the content. The projects were fun and I found myself spending many additional hours to add content and functionality to my previously submitted projects.

I have two (small) complaints. There were a couple videos (or segments within a video) where the audio was a little hard to hear and it would be nice if the video resized with the window. I often worked with two windows open side by side on a single monitor and would overlap the windows to get everything I needed on screen. Minor complaints overall. I've already recommended the course to several friends and may even retake it just for fun to see what I can do with CodeSkulptor. Some students have shown that it's very powerful when you have the right knowledge.

Thanks Scott, Joe, John, Stephen, and Coursera for this course. I'm really looking forward to the next courses and continuing to learn Python!

                    I worked professionally as a Software Developer but I had never used Python. Part of the reason I took the course was that Python is often used on the Raspberry Pi and used in Security Software which I have an interest. 

The project assignments are also a lot of fun to do.

                    It was a great MOOC, it learns programming in Python quite well. The interaction with the small projects also means that you can solve things differently and get feedback. I followed another MOOC on programming and quit it because it didn't have this very god peer review structure.

                    I thought both Joe and Scott were excellent instructors.  The course material, including both the projects and the quizzes were very instructive and motivational.  I began the course fairly cynical since I was never a gamer and am a senior applied mathematician who has been programming for many years.  A couple of weeks into the course I was already a believer in using interactive games to motivate and learn python.  Highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn Python.

                    This is an excellent course to learn the basics of python, especially if you like to have fun.  All of the programs you build are small games and the lecturers are clearly enjoying themselves.
At the beginning it does go a little fast if you've never done any programming or have no clue of programming concepts, but it's quite easy to fill in the blanks with a little reading on the side and the community forum is very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the basics of python, or just wants to get to grips with programming in general.

                    Really great to write a game in Python language and  the knowledge is required to do it. Teachers were providing this knowledge in a best way - simple, understandable, funny. In my opinion it is very hard to provide such complex knowledge to people that they understands it and these teachers were doing this perfectly, thanks.

One thing that I really liked was the ability to do the projects from any computer using CodeSkulptor. I could go between my regular laptop to my Chromebook to a desktop, and it didn't matter. This made it very convenient.

                    This was a great course, though I came with some experience in programming (in other languages), there was  no dull moment. The instructors explained the stuff very patiently and clearly (and coursera has the nice option to speed up the lectures, in case the talked issue is already known q understood). Also, every question have been answered in forums in no-time.
The mini-projects were well described, and fully covered the material.
I'm waiting for and expecting the following courses offered by these instructors in coursera.

                    Python while not the new kid on the block is very much a favourite, especially for scientific computing which is largely where my interests lie. I do have a background in C.S. but in procedural rather than OO languages. I found this a great introduction to OO in general and Python in particular. The course moved at just the right speed for me and the projects provided enough challenge to keep me interested while not being so difficult as to be offputting. I've taken quite a lot of MOOCs now and this is certainly one of the best I've done - highly recommended.

This helped us in applying the concepts which we have learned so far. The professors taught the concepts in a very simple way so that even a beginner can understand them well. The quality of the quizzes was very good and required good understanding of the concepts to answer the questions. After completing this course I have gained a lot of confidence in programming in python.The support provided by the CTA's was excellent. They were always available for help when in need.I would recommend this course to everyone who want to learn python.

Coursera really good platform, in the second part of the class had a problem viewing videos online, mb due to insufficient capacity of platform, but provider gives the opportunity to download videos and watch them offline.

                    Before taking this class, I had no knowledge of Python. I was a little scared and worried I would get lost quickly.

However, the video lectures for the course were amazing - to put it in perspective, I wish I had had lecturers this good during my Biochemistry degree at Imperial College.

Everything was broken down into short videos for very specific topics, and we had a multiple choice quiz, and programming project every week. 

In fact, we built a new game using a tool called Codeskulptor every single week, and each time I marvelled at how far I had come. My favourites to build were Pong, Blackjack and RiceRocks(similar to Asteroids). 

I should also say that it was immensely fun and satisfying to review the work of other peers - to play their game and see how it handled differently, and to look at how they have implemented and structured their code.  From doing this, I found new ways to code more concisely and effectively, and realised how many different ways were possible. 

I also benefited a lot from the coding templates provided in this course - I learnt how to break things down into little sections, and how to structure my code in a logical order. A lot of other courses I have done, did not give me nearly enough advise on this, so I found this course incredibly useful.

I cannot recommend enough!!!

                    From my side, course content seems to be carefully designed and is enough for this stage. I'm sure in other classes, we will explore more to do with python, such as extracting data from web.
In fact, there is no much to say about the instructors. They are teaching at Rice, one of the most well-known universities in the world; their teaching methods and advices are pretty impressive and  their methods are working even for the ones who doesnt have prior programming experience. I'd like to thank them for their willingness and share their valuable time for this course to make more people have better knowledge.
Also, there is not much to say Coursera, which has a life-changing impact. If correctly used, Coursera can open lots of new rooms in many aspect in our lives, put new personel targets and these in return I'm sure will make our world better.

                    an excellent, engaging course!
i had prior programming experience in other languages and knew very little of Python. i have a great interest in games but had no particular goal of learning interactive programming -- my goal was primarily just to learn more of Python... which not only i did but i now have an interest in actually programming games too. 
i enjoyed myself immensely during this course.

                    The last time I wrote a line of code was almost a decade ago. Even back then, I was oblivious to the existence of Python. I took this class as an opportunity to have some fun while learning something that seemed powerful, yet managable. I consider myself fortunate to have stumbled upon this MOOC. After the complition of the two parts, I can safely say that I am hooked. Both on Python and the Intructors as well. John and Scott made this a class an awesome experience. I am looking forward to learning with them in the near future.

Codeskulptor makes it very easy to access your work whether you're at home or out and about. This allows you to access your work on public computers as well. The teachers were engaging, funny, and created a positive online atmosphere in which to learn useful skills in Python. Also, the fact that we learned the concepts through game programming added for an extra layer of entertainment while learning the course. This gives the student something to show for what they have done once they finish each project.

                    This class was great. I already knew some basic Python and mostly wanted to solidify that and learn about event driven programming. The course was just the right pace for me (having some prior experience) but may be a little fast for a total noob. 

The video lectures were very clear and helpful, but for me personally I wish they had not included quite so many details of how to do things in the projects, and let me figure them out myself. The style of the videos and production quality was very good, and I enjoyed the personal and humerous parts a lot. I really felt like I got to know the instructors a bit while taking the course.

The projects were really fun. As with the videos I may have liked a little less pre-coded structure, but for a beginner this was probably necessary. 

Overall I really enjoyed this course, learned a lot, and would definitely recommend it to a friend.

                    The class was realy intersting and exciting. Wouldn't say it was challenging - all the quizzes and mini projects was not hard, but still they did require some hours of work and knowing the week's material.
Lectures were easy to understand, all the material needed was given on lectures. There were enough practice exercise to consolidate the knowlege.

I would definitely suggest this course to anyone starting his way to the computer science.

                    The design of this course is very neat. The combination of video teaching, quiz, miniprojects and practice is a good way to learn. Particularly, the practice helps form ideas as well as part of codes in the miniproject. It will be even more helpful if more videos are available (i know this is demanding). Also, walking through some Python code snippets will contribute speeding up learning curve as well.

The good thing of coursera is the flexible time schedule. Honestly, I've done all the assignments but never completed any of them on time. The important thing is to keep one's own pace and squeeze enough time to learn and apply this skill in one's career in future.

Taking courses from Scott and Joe reminds me how suck many my instructors do. Sincerely appreciated. I enjoy learning with fun.

                    CodeSkulptor is really awesome. At first I was confused with the way it works, but later on it helped me a lot. Although I had only a little informal experience on calculation using Python, I think I could learn very efficiently how to construct a game program.

This course takes Python to a higher level and makes it fun and very interesting with the programming game concept.

Thank you so much, the course was great.

                    Excellent and fun class to take. I've been programming or quite some years, but moving to the GUI programming was new. Having recently learned Python, this was an excellent chance to combine both of them. Who would have  thought that I would be writing Asteroids in Python myself. And also wondering: how the heck did they do it back in the 80s without OO?

                    Outstanding, clear clarification on many basic and little more advanced issues in python. Very good for beginners or as the first course. All course materials have appriopriate taxonomy, that support fast learning. Most valuable thing in course are mini-projects, that shows practical aspects on using python, way of thinking during coding, way of solving problems with use of decomposition and changing it in pure code. Summing up it is one of best IT courses I have ever attended.

                    It is a great course for everyone who has little or no experience in programming.
The course was taught for eight weeks with each week culminating in completion of a small game. 
It is not the first class that I signed up for on Coursera,  yet it is the first one that I was able to complete thanks to informative lectures, productive discussion boards, and, last but not least, comments  from TAs, concerning programming tips.  

Thank you very much, Joe, Scott, John, and mysterious Stephen!

                    The course is much fun, especially those videos Joe making jokes about Scott. Moreover, the course is very instructive in learning to program for the first time. The only possible con is that the course relies heavily on the GUI and the game, more insight about thinking as a programmer or computer scientist is to be learnt in the later course : Principles of Computing

                    The instructors apply what every good teacher knows: that students learn best when they are happy and having fun. So they are able to teach some pretty sophisticated concepts in an enjoyable class. As the course grows and matures, I hope they can add some optional lectures throughout the course on porting the projects to a standard graphical user interface like TkInter.

                    Instructors are awesome and fun and they really inspire you to work hard while also helping you along the way. Content is distributed at acceptable pace for beginners and those with some prior knowledge might have easier time grasping the content. Last three weeks might have greater jump in difficulty but if you take time to think everything through and read the forums for advice you'll be surely able to complete the projects. This has been one of the best programming classes and one of the best MOOCs I have attended so far. Highly recommended!

                    The class was fun and I really feel I have learned a good deal of python as wel as OOP.
The structure of OOP comes out very well and it had a real beneficial effect for me on intermediate languages to apply the code structure there to. The assesments were challenging, in a good way. I had no programming experience and it worked well for me.

But the steady and consistent and step by step approach of each of the videos have instilled confidence in me. I really appreciate the way the course is developed and would certainly recommend such a great course to people I know. Thanks for the effort and wishing to see more and more lectures from the trio.

                    Very hard course, but well prepared and structured. I learned much more that I expected to learn and I really enjoyed the course (including these few moments of absolute desperation during the last hours before mini-project deadlines.... :-D ).Very rewarding and enjoyable course. The videos summarize well the topics and the exercises and mini-projects are the real learning power. I had a lot of fun doing the mini-projects and evaluating the work of other students!

                    I couldn't recommend this course highly enough, as a total beginner to Python I've absolutely loved it and feel like I've learned a ton. The pacing is fantastic, it was rarely too easy or too hard, but information dense and consistently challenging at just the right level based on what's been taught that week. Each week also builds beautifully upon what's been learned in the previous weeks and the projects are designed to integrate everything you've learned up to that point. Just masterfully done. You really get the sense that a ridiculous amount of time and effort has been put into creating and polishing this course. The professors are brilliant teachers and tremendously likeable. Codeskulptor was created for this course and it's such a great introduction and a powerful tool (as showcased by some of the projects in the Hall of Fame). The forums are priceless with really helpful contributors and TAs. 
I can't thank these guys enough so felt compelled to leave a glowing review. It really is the least I can do. Kinda sad it's ended :(

                    The instructors were fantastic in their playful approach. They also were able to convey OO concepts and immediately have us using them, without a lot of theory that sometimes makes OO too complicated. The game recipe approach - breaking the mini-projects into small focused tasks - made it very effective in thinking what to do next! Great job!

                    It's an interesting way to learn Python concepts even if you aren't really into gaming.  One of the benefits is that most of the stuff you do for the class has a visual element, which can make it easier to grasp what is happening in the code.  This was not my first Python beginner class, but it helped me to much better understand certain concepts, such as object-oriented programming, more easily due to the visual element and the time the professors took to work us through it.

I have started learning Computer Science , after 10 years i received my Bachelor degree in Physics. And this class really helped to understand some basics about programming and get started programming aswell.
I have started this class and left it not completed from the first time. After half a year i decided to complete it from the start and get certificate. Now I have completed both parts and got certificates. This is awesome!

                    Amazing class, great organization, fun teaching, engaging assignments. Although I have a degree in CS, I am a newbie to Python. I enrolled in this course as a way to mentor a near-15 teenager. He showed some interest in programming and I wanted him to have a study partner while he engaged in something challenging. I learned some Python along the way, had a lot of fun, got to witness first hand just how effective this course is at forming programming thinking in beginners, provided they have some support to get past the tough spots, both emotionally (some frustration is involved in coding&debugging) and intellectually (the object oriented philosophy was quite a sharp turn)

Joe and Scott in particular are great teachers and make the effort to make each class entertaining and rewarding. That isn't to say the course is easy, because it will challenge you (particularly if you have no prior programming knowledge). But it's worth it!

                    I have attempted to introduce myself to programming and shell scripting many times. Most of the time I have leveraged books and web 'guides' to learn. I have never succeeded. I have managed to reverse engineer code and muddle my way through, but NEVER understood. This course changed all of that for me (and allowed me to go back and better understand my previous attempts). I HIGHLY recommend this course. The instructors are great (much appreciation to Scott and Joe) and the content is schedule allowed me to fit in the education along side my full time job. 5 stars all the way!!

                    This was the best class I have ever taken, live or on-line. These guys really took the time to think about what the student needs. The material is preemptive, as if they know where the student is going to struggle and so they spend extra time on those critical elements.  Thank you all for creating this learning experience for me.

                    This is only the second course I have tried on Coursera but it was excellent and so inspiring. The lectureres were engaging and the miniprojects had me up all night dreaming about coding. I didn't use the discussion forums until the final few weeks when it got trickier but they turned out to be very useful and I wished I had read them sooner to get more tips. Thank you to Joe and Scott for your injection of humour into the course. Studying this course become a really welcome part of my week that I looked forward to and I can't wait for the next part to start.

It is challenging and pushes you to figure out things on your own, but also offers plenty of help and support. The instructors present the subject in a very clear and structured manner and the lectures are engaging and actually fun to watch.

                    This MOOC is hands-down the most fun I had in learning. One gets to show a game one created at the end which is very satisfying. 
The instructors are great entertainers and sometimes it feels like watching an action movie!
However, it was a difficult course that demanded 8-10 hours a week and I have a little prior programming experience. For an absolute beginner, I recommend investing a bit more time. It will be rewarding for sure. I did well in the course but the course does not offer statement of accomplishment but offers signature track certification.

This course teach programming through making classic game in python and as IDE codesculptor.org is used. As codesculptor being ran in web browser, I didn't have to worry about installing compiler, or software in my computer. And lastly, the instructors, Scott Rixner and Joe Warren, they are brilliant and funny and you won't be never bored watching course videos.

                    The best thing about this course is that, like all the best things in life, it keeps getting BETTER. I can say this with authority, because I tried to complete its first edition and I had to drop. Then I tried the 2nd edition and I had to drop again. The 3rd time was the charm however, the instructors passion for this course is inspiring, they put in crazy hours, unpaid, to keep the forums running and give thousands and thousands of students feedback and encouragement.

That's ignoring the fact that they have built not just a developer environment that runs efficiently in the browser, a python module for that environment to run graphics and user interfaces, AND a visualization tool, that can step you through any program you load, and show how your instructions are placed in memory and operated upon. Astonishing.

If you can put in the time, and you may need to watch the lecture videos two, even three times, do the exercises, work the quizzes until you have a 95 or better, and obviously complete your weekly programming projects, then you will get a solid grasp of programming fundamentals.

I cannot recommend this class highly enough for someone interested in programming or digital game design. Also if you have the time, the codecademy python course is an excellent supplement.

                    Excellent, especially if you are new to Python.
The course requires you to take quizzes and do assignments, which are tremendously helpful learning experiences.
The assignments are around programming games, so the end result is something you can play with.

Highly Recommended, I had a lot of fun and I have learned many new concepts not only about python but about programming itself.

                    I have studied industrial engineering, but in my university everything was really theoretic. We use to write our C/C+ codes in paper and never try them in the computer, just imagine the result of that... Each time somebody named something about programming...I ran away.

                    While this was my first MOOC, I found the content to be thoroughly explained. My previous experience with Python was minimal and self-taught.

I honestly recommend this course to anyone trying to get into Python.

                    I enjoyed the course structure and content, the excellent lectures and instructors. I did not enjoy the deadlines--the quizzes always seemed a bit more difficult than anticipated and the mini-projects were progressively more difficult each week. In fact, I was unable to complete the last two object-oriented programming projects--I just couldn't break through with the concepts, and the deadlines were ultimately ignored as a result. Thanks for presenting a well-organized course on programming. I hope to take it again and actually complete every assignment

                    I had some background in programming but Python was always an uncanny world to me. With the help of this course, not only I refreshed my knowledge on OOP, I also learnt Python to a satisfactory extend. I also learnt a lot about game development and testing.

                    This the best class any one can get on Web. I tried many sites to learn different programming languages. I would eventually learn what I was trying to learn. But, it would usually take a lot of times with lot of pain, finding every piece of knowledge in different sites or books.  None of the classes were  as structural as this class. The material build slowly allow you to absorb and digest the subjects. There are good source of practice material that carefully crafted to easy the learning  It is not like most of web classes that start extremely easy and all of a sudden jump to a advance level, with big gap of missing knowledge in the middle. Which make you think: ""I must be not smart enough since I just don't get it now!"" No, don't fall for that trap! I took too many of those classes and I know when I see the ""trap door. "" This class was one of best, if not the best, I have ever got on web. Thank you to Rice University for making a high quality education available to all.

                    I must say that this really was excellent course. Second for me through Coursera. Class was very well structured and all mini projects built very well over subjects that were teached before. 
I had that moment where all seemed too hard, somewhere in the middle. But after that, it got somehow easy to do last weeks of the course. So I guess I learned something. 
For programming tasks, you don't need anything, course provides CodeSkulpture, which is very good.
So, if you like games and like to learn to do simple ones with Python, check it out!

                    Challenging enough to provide a real sense of accomplishment when each task is complete. I also liked that there is a lot of open-endedness to the projects. I really felt that my personality shined through my code, and I could see the personality of the people I graded as well. Very enlightening to see someone else's solution and think ""Ah-ha!

                    This course is awesome. You get to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming that apply beyond Python by the end of the course. What's most important though, is that you get to learn it in a very fun way, by building your own games and learning from two of the most interesting professors I've ever known. 
The instructors are all great. Prof. Rixner, Prof. Greiner personally built CodeSkulptor which is an online tool you can use to program in python. The same goes for simpleGUI as well. Spending those hours watching the video lectures really built a bond between me and all the instructors. 
Overall, if you're interested in the course, you should definitely try it out. I'm 95 percent confident you'll love it too! 
Oh yeah, and I'm going to Rice this fall as a freshman undergraduate. This course definitely contributed my decision making process in a positive way.

                    I studied Mathematics and Computer Science in the 80's and early 90's.  I spent a decade as a software developer and have spent 20 years in varying levels of software development management.  Having an ancient background in Computer Science, this class has been a joy and re-gaining some of my earlier passion.  The fine professors at Rice University keep their lectures light and fun.  The mini-projects are just at the right balance of being do-able, yet sometimes requiring some late nights to get them done.  This class was a lot of fun.  I'm very glad that I took it.

                    The instructors are great, they are easy to follow and make the videos and content enjoyable. The pace is very good for learning python, and there is good help resources particularly the forums. 

I explored avenues for taking what I learnt onwards and it seems to translate very well. I was happy to see that the end videos showed you where you can go with python moving forward. I had already planned a path but it was reassuring that they highlighted pretty much the same path!

So overall very enjoyable and a great way to learn programming. A+++ instructors =) And the course is FREE! Much appreciated!

                    This was an amazing course. I've taken other introductory programming courses including another one in Python but this was the most fun. You build a new game almost every week. It's a bit of a challenge but that's what makes you feel so accomplished by the end.

                    Astonishingly good- the best online course I've taken by far. This is truly a college level course, and so much deeper than a simple tutorial- you'll learn foundational concepts of programming that actually make programming easier. Tutorials don't help solve problems that require conceptualization. Best of all was the support- no question was left unanswered, and response was always quick and comprehensive.

                    I played around with Python a long time ago, teaching myself from python.org, but my efforts were not well directed, and I got bogged down in the details.  Rice's course kept me focused, and helped me to see what was important and what wasn't. The gimmick of having each weekly project be some kind of game kept my interest up while I was learning the intricacies of Python.  Scott Rixne'rs CodeSkulptor   web IDE was very valuable, allowing program composition and execution in my browser.  I feel that the course gave me a good basic understanding of the Python language, and I plan to build upon that foundation.  Thanks to Joe, Scott, John and Stephen!

                    This course is a fun and great way to lear programming. I've been programming profesionally for a long time, but took this course to get into Python. It's difficult for me to assess how easy or difficult this course is for a complete beginner, but I think this course teaches programming in a way that most people can follow. Some may find it fast paced at times, but if you don't grasp a concept, try asking in the forums.

Overall, a great introduction to programming.

                    Always wanted to make a computer game.  Now that I have there is no going back.  Having never written python but knowing its intrinsic value I wanted a more formal introduction.  This set of courses had topics that I rarely encounter so it made it interesting.

Cheers

                    very organized, Easy and complex at same time.
Learn making videogames are a very good way to learn.
It's also recommended if you have previous knowledge, because you can practice without spend much time
Totally recommendable!

The instructors made the course really fun and they tried (and succeeded!) to connect with the students and the material on a personal level. I highly recommend Rice's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python. I know I will find ways to use my new programming skills to improve my work and my life.

                    This class works extremely well as an introduction to Python for anyone with prior experience in programming.  It appears to work equally well as an introduction to programming for the well-motivated uninitiated.  Because of the focus on development of fully functioning games as projects, this class forces students to get considerably more practice in programming in Python than one gets by just doing the assignments in the more broadly aimed (but also good!) introductory class Programming for Everybody.   

This class is well thought out, well-structured, well-presented and well-supported.  The use of the codeskulptor.org tool, developed by one of the instructors, provides an easy entry point that enables one to get right into the material without getting bogged down in demotivating installation snafus.  

Plan to devote no fewer than eight hours a week to the class to derive good value from enrollment.

It represents a lot of work if you want to make it good, but it's worth the effort.

                    The whole course was outstanding, well organized and well presented.  It allowed me to progress way farther than I ever thought I would be able to.   I've taken > 15 Coursera courses and I think this is among the best.  I look forward to taking more courses with these instructors and in thee area of python programming.

It just so happened that I was taking Programming for Everybody (Python) from Univ of Michigan with Charles Severance and it was a great contrast because that course was more file and text based than this gui oriented class.  I also found some on utube and am enjoying exploring further.

                    Nearly fifty years old and working in tech for all my life I had never so much fun and aver taking a more rewarding programming course. This the best curriculum you can imagine if you want to understand and learn python. The tools, the content and the incremental steps you experience as a student keep you going. One thing though is, that as beginner you should schedule more time than proposed - much more time. You will see that the additional material, practices are needed to grasp the content, if you are not familiar with other programming languages.  This is a fast pace course which brings you quiet far, if you are a beginner, you can still master it, but need the additional material and going through this just takes time.

                    Had a lot of fun doing this course! I had already programmed with several languages before, but programming Python GUIs was new to me so there was still a lot to learn. At the same time, I believe this class is perfectly doable for complete beginners.

The course instructors were really fun. I totally enjoyed Joe and Scott's ongoing rivalry and goofing around while testing the games. The special guest in week 7 was a really pleasant surprise too!

                    Loved the class, however I wish I had taken the first class as well. They suggested and allowed us to look at the videos etc of the first class but with time at a premium (due dates on current class) I could only skim over them.

                    I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn python and modern programing.  The instructors take you through a series of mini projects where you learn how to use handlers and classes to write games. Not only do you learn, but you have fun doing it.

                    A real hard dive in the Python program.

In only 8 weeks of time, the course (split into two parts) means to take the student from complete Python beginner to a good knowledge of the main nuts and bolts of the language, and all the programming concept that comes with it.

The main item of practice is a webIDE called CodeSkulptor, it implements the possibility to play around with a slightly simplified version of Python 2.7 and a graphic module called simpleGUI to create various games, from pong to the final, 300+ lines of code that builds RiceRocks, the asteroid game.

Most of the course is fun to watch, and while it requires effort to be followed, it really pays off in terms of skills and final satisfaction.

I recommend it to all beginner coders out there, if they feel they can free up a couple days a week at most to dive in Python and programming.

                    Fantastic course. I'd be doing everyone a great disservice if I rate this course anything below five stars. Wonderful instructors and well structured practice exercises and projects.

Let me warn you, though. The learning curve gets steeper as you reach week 4 and onwards. The 7~10 hours/week workload is more inclined toward the higher side. If fact, I had to spend 12 hours each on Pong and Memory, 18 hours on Blackjack( Yep, you read that right :) ) and 14 hours each on Spaceship and Asteroids.

You should be fine if you give it 2 hours daily, and progress in the sequence specified by the instructors. (Watch lectures >> Do practice exercises >> Do quizzes >> Do project >> Revert back to lectures if you feel you've missed something in between). It's rigorous sometimes, but totally worth the effort. And there's plenty of help from the community TAs, fellow Pythonistas, and the instructors(Code Clinic) if you ever need it.

Thank you, Scott, Joe, John, Stephen, Coursera and Rice University. You've changed my life. :) I'm eagerly looking forward to the next offering in the series (Principles of Computing).

                    Fast paced class, designed in such a way that you will put a lot of effort to get it done, will frustrate you at times, but great eureka moments when you figure some things out. Forum discussion is a tremendous help to understand many of the concepts and to learn from others. TA are extremely helpful. After many hours of lectures, I have become fond of the instructors and their peculiar sense of humor :) . Late submission option allows slower students like myself to still finish the class at a more realistic pace. In short: excellent class. Highly recommended.

                    I'm a retired Chemical Engineer and noticed sites like coursera and edx. It is really hard for me to believe that such media is available to allow anyone with an Internet connection and computer to receive quality education. I thoroughly enjoyed the Introduction to Interactive Python Programming offered by Rice University. The course was challenging but fun. Thanks to the Instructors and all that made this possible. Great job!!!  ...and Thanks a Bunch.

I had to spend around 10 hours per week but it was so interesting and challenging that I could not stop in between. At the end of the course i can think my own logic, find my own ways to implement them and troubleshoot it with confidence.

                    Good way to learn Python. Nice pace. 

I am an engineer by trade and the field I am in is progressively becoming more reliant on programming. As such, an understanding of basic computer science is needed. This class gives a very useful, well taught, and interesting introduction in computer science. For one, it uses Python which is probably the best for those starting to understand programming and computer science. Another aspect is the focus on building games. Project-based learning makes it easier to comprehend the nuances of programming and the use of games makes it interesting. Finally, the amount of lame jokes and weird behaviors by the professors helps make the course not as intimidating as would, say, learning a programming language just through the documentation. 

To sum up, this is a good course to learn programming and computer science regardless of what aims you have for your education.

I enjoyed working on all the projects  and the completion of final code makes you feel a great sense of accomplishment. I must say i was skeptical the first time I heard that we would be creating the asteroids game as final project. But the doubts melted away with each passing week.
I would recommend this class to anyone looking to start with Python.

                    From zero programming experience to few games developed under Rice University professors' guidance in 9 weeks. Pretty impresive. Quite challenging for beginners, but always very rewarding. I recommed to everyone looking for good programming intro MOOC

                    This is a highly organized, effective, and fun course that only teaches the student how to build real-life practical projects, but also teaches the student on what can be accomplished in class or in life when things are highly organized, effective, and done with a fun spin on it. This class is for anyone wishing to REALLY learn Python.

                    The course is really quite good. All the material you need to complete the course is supplied. 
I would suggest that this is probably not the course to take if you are a rank beginner. In my humble opinion if this is a beginner course it would more likely be classified as an Advanced beginner course. If you choose to take it I would plan to spend more then the recommended 10 weekly hours and take advantage of working the practice exercises, and read the forums, work inside of a small group. 
There is enough material there  I feel for me it would be worth while to take the course again.

CodeSkulptor is the tool developed by one of the lecturers for learning Python in this course. It is easy to use and powerful. The Viz mode is the invaluable debugging tool built-in. The only improvement to make is on its documentation. Other than that, it's perfect.

Highly recommended this course to everyone!

The class covers key concepts in Python and in the idea behind programming. It is designed for those who have no prior programming experience. And it brings them to a final state that they can build a fantastic game that is very fun and playable. It is amazing to walk through this process. After finishing this course, you will have a great sense of achievement and get more confidence.
The two professors are really nice, kind and helpful. They are also very careful and patient. It adds charm to this class since watching them teaching is just like sitting with a nice man who is telling stories to you :)

Tests were written in such a way to not just insure things were memorized, but that you could apply that learning. Being able to push quiz due dates makes this class easier to take even if your schedule sometimes conflicts. Projects were designed to easily allow accurate peer grading. They were the type of projects I more often associate with an in person class, which kept me engaged.

                    This was a well structured course. They covered the basics of programming, but also gave us interesting and challenging projects to complete. If you have not studied programming before, this is a good introduction. But, you must be motivated to learn the subject. I probably spent 8 - 10 hours a week on everything - watching videos, taking quizzes, completing the projects, and doing evaluations. It was worth it.

                    This class was very difficult but rewarding. Much more challenging and interesting than the other python MOOC that I did.  I took the second half of the class without having done part 1 - this was a mistake, but fortunately the materials from part 1 were still available and I was able to rush through them the first week of class.  All of the projects for this class were very challenging, but I had a great sense of accomplishment when I finished each of them.

I have nothing to do with this programming thing (I work as a family physician, so it's difficult for me to imagine a work more away from computer programming) but these guys got me hooked. Really nice teachers, not easy but doable assignments and a lot of information to digest. Thanks again, and if you're into python programming, or starting any kind of programming, you should take a look at this course...

                    The content was stretching and challenging but not too stretching/challenging.  I was completely new to this language but found the emphasis on games as the vehicle for learning very useful and interesting.  The CodeSkulptor browser based programming environment made the learning process that much easier.  The mix of lectures, exercises, quizzes and assignments was well judged.  The discussion forum and the assistance provided in the form of templates for each assignment, again, were well balanced.  The lecturers were very engaging and their good humoured approach to the subject helped.

I did have a fair bit of programming experience.  I do a little in my job.  So, the course load was not too heavy.  I don't remember looking forward to the next assignment in college.

It was fun to wathc the videos, the exercises were challenging and the quizzes made you think.

                    Probably the best MOOC I have participated in (and I've done 4-5 at this point).  The instructors are very engaging and make the material fun (but hey, you make games so how could it not be fun).  The tools for this class, Codeskulptor in particular are well thought out and easy to get started with and use.  The forums were very active and helped in a lot of situations.  I took one star off on provider because the Coursera site is pretty dense and can be hard to navigate when you first use it, but it's generally well designed and completely functional.

The instructors are awesome and it is obvious that they have put a lot of thought into the structure of the course and the way they are introducing and using new concepts.

                    Great class for beginners. A lot of handholding so you're able to complete the projects, but it is still very time consuming and can be difficult to grasp some of the concepts taught. If you do the practice exercises, read the forums, and watch all of the lectures you shouldn't have a problem completing the class, and although very enjoyable, it will consume a lot of your free time.

                    Wow.  What an amazing class and set of instructors.  I've worked in IT all my adult life (30 years!) and have a Computer Science degree from a  first tier university.  The sense of fun and accomplishment I enjoyed in the last two months rivals the experience of many years ago when I was programming in assembler (DEC VAX  Macro-32), Pascal, and later C++.  In fact, in presentation and accessibility, this class tops them all.  The amount of information, help tools, Viz mode, PDFs, the quality of the video lectures, the humor, make it an incredible learning experience.

Programming is not easy.  The topics covered here are complex.  But, this class does an amazing job in easing one into the wonderful field of programming and Computer Science.

Thank you professors Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong, and Rice University for a beautiful job.

                    This has been a great course! I was immediately hooked. Although, I've had prior experience with Python, I've never used object orientation before and I've always had the feeling that I am struggling. 
Now, I feel much more accomplished and ""dangerous"" - as the instructors like to call it. 
Instructors & Atmosphere: The instructors are very likable and genuinely care about the course and their students. The course atmosphere is very congenial and makes browsing through the forums a great pleasure. 
Pace: For me, as I was familiar with many of the concepts, the course's pace was excellent. I think that if you are a complete programming beginner, you will be struggling a fair bit. However, initial struggles are normal and there is help: Remember to check the forums, people are very active and helpful there. Also, the instructors have set up a ""code clinic"". Course TA's will have a look at your code and help you out.  
I thoroughly enjoyed the class and am very likely to continue the computation series with ""Principles of Computation"".

                    Very well done course, I've learned a lot and it's not been painful, I wish it could go on.  Will definitely be following on further courses from the same team.  Coursera's forums are like something from the ark but it's the people on them that make them worthwhile, Rice's content and Instructors have been great.  The whole thing has been very well thought out.  Heartily recommend, even to people with a bit of experience in programming already.

                    I really enjoyed the class.  I like the fun approach to programming and really like the CodeSkulptor and Simplegui tools.  I have a little bit of prior programming knowledge and experience but still found the subject and presentation interesting and informative.

                    The course content was excellent, easy to follow, yet challenging and fun. The instructor videos were entertaining while covering a lot of material. The CodeSkulptor tool and Viz module made programming really simple to accomplish and debug, and gives immediate feedback. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Python, object oriented programming, and/or game-building.

                    I learned a lot, but it took a lot of time. The teachers are great, the forums are great source of help, the community TA's are fantastic, but it moves at a rapid pace. 

That may be a good thing. Besides teaching you programming, if you stick with this class, you will learn a lot about your own level of resolve, grit resiliency and determination. Ultimately, that may be the best out come of the experience.

                    This class was awesome. I felt like I learned a decent amount of programming.
It seemed like a good class in that regard, but what made the class really
special was that it felt like I was just hanging out with friends. These guys
don't even know me. I never even commented on the message boards. Heck, I
never even handed in any assignments (I did them all on my own time long after
the due dates had passed.), but I feel like these guys are my friends. I can't
wait to take some more classes with them.

                    I started learning programming seversl times, but never could move futher
elementary things. But this class breathed inspiration and motivation to my
brain, so i could finish it and make all projects, although never finished
them due to dead line ))  (brcause lack of time)

Thanks to teachers, great class !

                    I learned more than I expected I would. It was a lot of work (or maybe I'm not
that efficient) but I really enjoyed the projects and was very satisfied with
what I achieved.

I loved that the assignments were well scaffolded and the instructors taught
what we needed to know to have success. We still had to do the work though!
The marking rubrics were clear.

One or two rubrics could be tweaked to reflect better the objectives of the
assignment. They work fine now but could perhaps be a bit more specific.

                    Python (and all modern programming languages) were like a mystery to me. I
wanted to get to the point where I could at least read a program (a simple
one) in python and figure out what it was doing. In fact, I got a lot more
than that - I was very surprised to discover how user-friendly python is, and
how transparent a lot of the language is. So now I would feel fully confident
in writing a lot of straight forward programs in python - perhaps not building
a complex game from scratch, but certainly programs that would do engineering
calculations (I'm an engineer) or financial planning.  

What I most liked were the quizzes and mini-projects, which forced us to use
the lecture material and concepts right away. I found them just the right
level of difficult, in the sense that I often had to consult the
documentation, I had to try and fail sometimes, but in the end they were
always do-able, and there was always support when needed.  

There is very little I didn't like or that needs to be improved. It was a
really good course. As a person who hadn't programmed for years, and had never
used python, I suddenly feel fully able to read and write programs in python.

were great and I learned the basics in Python in a fun and simple way. I have
some prior programming knowledge but I still think this is a great first
programming course where you can learn how to think when you build programs. I
have recommended the course to everyone I know. The only improvement would be
to mark Viz mode as a extra optional feature instead of introducing it in the
normal video category. It took me a few weeks to realize it is a totally
unnecessary tool if you can troubleshoot your program anyway.

                    I was just  interested in knowing how programs for interactive games are
written. I never imagined that within eight weeks, I myself will be able to
write highly interesting and visually attractive  games. Peer evaluation as a
learning tool is a great help. The only annoying thing was that I had to spare
as many as 16 hours a week, but that was understandable because I was starting
from scratch. The English source sub-titles are not very satisfactory (perhaps
because they are computer generated), this can be a major hurdle for non-
English speaking students.

                    I expected to learn Python and its GUI in interactive game programming. This
is what was taught - but not only this - much more. The  instructors gave a
full course in ""intro to computer science"" with all the exercises and the like
for this intro course. The material got up to a fairly high level at the end
of the 9 week course.

I would not change a thing in the course. The course was outstanding as it
was. I learned some new things. There was a tremendous amount of material
covered and all in 9 weeks.

                    It is a very carefully structured course. You start with the easy part and
gradully build toward the more complex concepts. It may sound trivial, but
this course really makes it! I started with very small programming experience
and could complete the course and build my own Asteroids game, after a lot of
other games as weekly mini-projects.

ideas became clearer to me. I had already taken a Python course form Dr. Chuck
Severson but this course went into more of the functions of python. I liked
the application of iy to a game that used quite a few classes and sets and

                    I expected a first approach to Python, I didn't know we were going to start
writing code for games. It was much more fun than I expected. I like using
codeSkulptore but I dislike not having an assignment using the conventional
platform. Although at the end it is told how to evolve to a desktop
environment so it wasn't that bad. I don't know what could I improve it was
very very neat, maybe I'll add an exercise not using codeSkulptore.

                    I expected to learn basic programming skills (in Python), and I did, and more.
The course gave me an excellent understanding of OOP (object-oriented
programming), something I've heard and read about for years, but was clueless
about. Plus the course gives you a great foundation in GUI and graphics,
something I wasn't expecting to be so rich, but which was excellent. My one
suggestion and feature I'd like would be the addition of either structured
notes for the course (as in a basic reference text) or suggestions of 3rd
party texts that could be purchased as supplemental material.

                    Things that I like:

  1. Progressive weekly assignment that are specifically designed to help students understand concepts taught in lecture. 
  2. The steps for each assignment is clear and easy to understand most of the time.
  3. Marking scheme for each assignment is clear and easy to understand most of the time.
  4. The lecture videos includes ""Programming Tips"" section that provides immediately useful programming techniques and information such as common pitfalls to avoid.
  5. Relevant game resources e.g. music and pictures, are provided so that students can focus on the core learning.

Things I dislike:

  1. Nothing really!

Things to improve:

  1. Perhaps they can provide a soft deadline and hard deadline. Assignments have to be submitted within a week and sometimes unexpected situation crops up which may prevent you from completing the assignments on time

                    I took this course as a recommendation from friend who had passed it, I knew
exactly what to expect - making many funny games while learning a lot of
Python. Maybe I would have wanted even a bit more examples and explanations
for some things, especially in the last classes where things were getting more
complicated.

One improvement: I would suggest to provide code of the mini project after the
deadline, as sometimes you want to compare your implementation with
instructors' implementation to make sure whether you did it right or not.

                    This was a great way to put the material learned to practical use.  This is in
sharp contrast to Codecademy, where you just follow the directions and don't
really write much in the way of original code or implement your own methods.

One minor criticism, though.  I would have liked the opportunity to create
classes from scratch for the practice of it.  In the projects that use
classes, the classes are already defined in the templates and students simply
add methods to them.

                    Thank you very much to all staff for a great class experience.

There were lot of guidelines and templates to constrain our thinking in most
productive and useful way, and they helped a lot in completing the assignments
in time and learning the stuff along with it. And then we were free to wander
around in the assignments, adding whatever additional features we could. This
made the course very valuable and enriching.

For improvement - There are many more topics that are not even touched upon. I
would like to see a 10-15 minutes session that takes you on a quick
informative ride of many features like file I/O, database storage, and other
useful applications that can be built with Python.

                    This is a very good course for beginner programmers since the professors
structured the course to help them. Also the fact you get to do something
practical with programming makes it even better since it shows beginners what
can be done with programming. Usually beginner programming courses focus more
on concepts and so the beginner student doesn't see the point. Having them
make games help them see some practical applications. Since video games are
becoming more and more mainstream, having the students make games is also a
good way to get the masses interested in computer science.

  

If you are an experienced programmer, this class is still good. Python is a
fairly new language so it's a good way to help experienced programmers get
used to this new language. If you are new to video game design, this class
will interest you even more.

                    I expected to be able to write somewhat sophisticated programs in Python, and
I think that goal was clearly achieved due to the efforts of Profs. Warren and
Rixner. Loved this well-structured course, the programming assignments were
really fun, and I hope that many more people sign up and benefit from this
class.

                    I expect to learn more about Python than all things I knew before. Just the
first class was boring because they work basic things that I knew. But the
profesors were very funny and they managed very well all the rest of the
course. Maybe they could improve the part of exercise. Maybe more exercise
with more examples could have been a better guide to learn.

                    I expected to learn how to program in python.

I liked the game-oriented approach. I disliked the lack of advanced OOP, but I
guess as it is an introduction course, the amount of OOP taught is just right.

Not sure if there is need to improve anything, if it ain't broken, do not fix
it.

Maybe proofread the English subtitles (if they are manually uploaded to
Coursera) and make sure they contain the correct words being said.

                    Learn python and develop cool games.

I liked the way it was delivered and how fun it was.

Maybe would add a few more optional projects/videos at the end to improve

                    I was uncertain of what I was going to learn, but hoped to find a course that
gave me a more concrete idea of programming basics. I got exactly what I
wanted. The course was, generally, very well paced and clarified programming
concepts in a way that I have not experienced before. The use of games to
introduce this concepts was excellent and kept interest in a way that coding a
school database that you know nobody will ever use would not. The two main
things I would improve would be:  
(1) The inclusion of instruction in one of the weeks on a viable order for
using all the extras (practice examples etc). They are incredibly useful, but
the number of them sometimes confused me into using them when I didn't
understand them yet, or past the point when they would have helped most.

(2) A little more coding guidance for Object Orientated Programming since I
had misunderstandings about it left over from other courses.

Joe and Scott are the DNA of this course and the core of Interactive
programming in Python.

The content of the video lectures and the practice environment are perfect for
success!

Coding may sound so cold and boring, but the games that we build were so cool
and challenging in the same time.  

I really enjoyed this course!

                    Excellent.  Instructors kept it interesting.  Really like the mini projects
they were much better than the code snipits required in other programs.  Using
games (creations of) to teach concepts may seem odd but was effective to teach
the fundamentals needed for more business focused task...

                    Great class with committed, qualified and humorous teachers.  
It was fun making the games. I've only ever programmed a bit of VB for
applications (Excel, mostly), so it was a bit hard at first. I enrolled with a
friend, and we watched the videos together almost every week. It's nice to
have someone to discuss concepts with. It was also helpful to go for the
certificate. It kept me going through the parts that were difficult for me.

                    I joined the course to learn python.  I guess I've learnt more than that. I
learn how to program games.

I love how the code skulptor is designed. I love how the teachers are very
interactive.

                    My expectations where about the programming language and I learned so much
more. In such a short time to learn about linear programming, working with a
gui, working with classes and between the lines working structuredly, in small
steps, with neat code as a result. This course screams for a follow up. Not
immediatly afterwards. 8 weeks with increasing difficulty and increasing study
hours is long enough.

Can't say where improvement is needed. It's complete. Maybe a follow up to
make android and iOS games.

Don't believe me. Try it yourself!

                    I learned more valuable things than I thought.

I like quizzes, excercises and combination of professional approach and a
loose atmosphere in video lecturers.

Sometimes I thought that one week it is not enough time to watch lectures, do
quiz and excersises, and do project (in particular in first program with
classes) and quietly delve into the knowledge of a given week, when you work.

completed this successfully if it had been my first course, but it was a very
valuable second course to take.  My skill level has skyrocketed with this
course.  It is incredibly time-intensive and challenging for a new programmer,

                    The video lectures were nice bite sized pieces that I could do on my commute
or lunch hour, and re-watch if needed.  Nice delivery with fun and humor.  I
sometimes felt guilty about all the provided help (project templates, testing
templates) but I see how this allowed us to cover a lot of territory within
the course timeline and it really helped to paint a picture of what is
possible.  Documentation and examples were very well done and helpful.

                    Yo aprendí los fundamentos de un nuevo lenguaje de programación. El curso está
tan bien estructurado que, una vez que lo  has concluido, te hace una
recomendación sobre cual es el mejor trayecto para ir más allá. Además, el
curso está subtitulado en español salvo algunas lecciones. Incluso en estas
últimas me percaté que podía ejercitar mi listening pues los docentes no
hablan demasiado rápido. Yo mejoraría del curso el subtitulaje íntegro de
todas las lecciones.

                    Yo esperaba conocer sobre un nuevo lenguaje de programación. Cuando inicié el
curso me percaté que estaba en inglés pero con subtítulos en español en la
mayoría de sesiones; cuando me percaté que había algunas subtituladas en
inglés fue cuando me percaté que también había estado practicando mis
habilidades para escuchar inglés así que este curso mejoró mis habilidades
auditivas. Yo mejoraría eso: que todas las sesiones estén subtituladas para

                    I wish that more time could be spent on the explanation of ""class"" and object-

probably other beginners as well! But overall, this is a great class and I
really appreciate the efforts from all the instructors!

to work at, since you get a decent experience at the end of it. I expected
some more details on Python but I understand all this could not be covered in
the duration of the class. Still, a very useful course for anyone, beginner or
experienced, to get their hands into programming. The instructors were
awesome, the most interesting chaps I have seen in all the courses till now.

                    I wasn't sure what to expect--more of a straight-forward dump of the Python
rules that wasn't going to be much fun, probably. As above, I liked the web-
based approach, the projects with all the help provided, the attitude of the
profs, the structure and progress of the course, and the Docs reference that
helped get over hurdles in understanding.

The pace of having something due every two days or so made it difficult to
keep up if weekends were taken up with other things and one had to work as
well...maybe stretch it to a 10-week course?

                    I expected to learn basic Python syntax, basic OO principles as implemented in
Python, and how to utilize 3rd party libraries in Python.

I really liked how each mini programming project had a detailed list of
implementation steps. It would be much like reading & implementing a list of
Agile-style user stories. This, I think, minimized the head-scratching that a
more open-ended prompt would have created.

The main thing I would improve is related to each week's quiz. If you're a
perfectionist like me, and do 2nd attempts at the quizzes when you don't get
100%, you'll occasionally find the same question marks different sets of
answers as correct on different versions of the same quiz. (some of the
questions change but some are the same between different attempts)

                    This class really exceeded my expectations. When I started I honestly didn't
see how i'd be capable of making a working Asteroids clone in 8-9 weeks!
Having weekly deadlines really drives you to commit time to the course which
is how you're able to make such quick progress. I found each weeks project
very challenging at the time of doing it but I think each week has its moment
where the penny drops and you understand a big concept that you take into the
following weeks. If you want a crash course in programming this course is
perfect.

                    Python. The course is fantastic in that it teaches Python by programming
simple games - at first very simple, but getting more complicated with each
week. They achieve this by hiding a lot of material in Codeskulptor, making it
easier for the student to get impressive results.

2) i like the experience of this MOOC , i disliked the fast pace nature in
some points example OOP.

3) Maybe to separate the objects into some more lectures and to change the
content more often.

  

GENERALLY I SUGGEST THIS COURSE ASAP FOR THOSE THEY WANT TO LEARN PYTHON.

Love the course and its pace. There were folks who complained that it was too
hard -- I suspect that they was learning programming for the first time.

Nothing to improve in the course. Would love a follow up course on advanced
topics, using and writing packages, software packaging and delivery specific
to python.

the Discussion forums that gave me most of the help I needed to finished the
course.  Without it I would not have finished half of the course.  For the
most part everything was great, but I would make the comments of the mini
projects required.  The reason for this is, I felt like I could get better but
I didn't know where I could improve my code.  Having another set of eyes look
at my code and then tell what and where to improve my code would have improved
my coding 10 fold.  That is the only thing I would improve.

                    I was not familiar with Python before the course. Now I think I am.

I have been favorably impressed by the peer evaluation process. If you do it
seriously, you do learn from other students.

I liked that the lecturers seemed to enjoy themselves while shooting. Good to
see professionals like what they are doing.

The mini-projects were great.

I wish I had used the forum more but did not have the time for that. On the
other hand, I've used it punctually on specific aspects and I've always found
relevant answers rapidly.

Need some extra course like ""Python tricks"":

\- text data parsing and syntax (paired with flex/bison maybe)

\- GUI (Tkinter and wxPython in parallel)

\- data visualization (GraphViz for abstact data types, and some powerful
general-purpose lib like PyVTK for measured & experimental data)

\- some network programming (http server for web-GUI, ftp/mail clients,
generic sockets)

contents are very interested and the structure is very clear. Would highly
recommend this course!

                    You can ACTUALLY learn Python so easily by just taking this course. Do
participate in the mini-projects since that is fun and at the same time makes
you more and more familiar with Python.

                    I wanted to try my hand at programming since I was on the computer a lot. I
wanted to go beyond gaming. That's when I found this course.  My heart dropped
when I saw the course syllabus! I thought I could never make it, because it
looked so complicated. Event-driven programming, local and global variables,
object-oriented programming, iteration, classes... Nothing was familiar to me
at that time. I thought I was going to learn text codes and HTML.

  

But thanks to all four teachers, Teacher Scott, Teacher Joe, Teacher Steven,
and Teacher John, I am now able to make interactive games in Python because
they were able to explain clearly to a neophyte like me. My secret is that I
downloaded all their videos from the course and started watching it all over
and over again if I don't get it in one shot, so even if the internet is down,
I can continue learning and appreciate the incremental process of programming.

You cannot beat around the bush when it comes to incremental coding because I
know deep inside that a small mistake regarding indentation or even a lacking
quotation mark will flop a Python program.  

  

Another thing is that some of my classmates are already experts in other
fields of programming. Ahhhh! This one really floored me. The good thing is
that you can ask about a certain topic and they'll answer with patience, and
some answer with humor. The catch? I felt that their eyes were all over my
project. They can easily tell the bluffs in my code.

  

What I liked about the course is the fact that I didn't need to download any
software, for there is an online-Python environment (CodeSkulptor) that I can
make games with. The class forums were helpful, for there were times I was
stuck in my mini-projects and several Community assistances and classmates
came to answer my questions. Everyone had a chance to post their thoughts and
their tips on how to complete a mini-project, and that's what spared my
grades. I was not however, allowed to post working code of up to 10 lines, and
that's part of the honor code which I somehow misunderstood.

  

What I dislike is that I have to wait around several weeks or several days for
your Statement of Accomplishment to arrive. That means that I have so many
classmates taking the course, especially with Signature Track, and the
teachers have to manually make sure that the student's photos and their typing
verification, including mine, matched, which was a bit tedious.

                    Prior to taking this class I had not had any Python experience and I was able
to follow the course through to completion.  The instructors do a great job
presenting the material in a way that non-programmers can understand.  There
were definitely times where I was left scratching my head after viewing the
lectures but the support from the TA's an the overall community on the forums
easily made up for that.  I would encourage anyone to take this class if for
nothing more than to gain a solid grasp on logical thinking.

                    I was expected to learn programming about python. There was no specific goals
because I haven't finished a python programming language. (They are somewhat
difficult.)

I appreciate the way of teaching (by completing mimi-project each week and a
final project of the whole course). I love games, and the reason that I want
to learn programming is related to games as well.

There is no obvious things that I dislike now.

amazing that you basically can start without any background in python, and end
up building  quite a complicated game like RiceRock after only 8 weeks.

                    Due to little exposure on programming in python before this class, I expected
to learn more on functions, loop, dictionaries etc but not writing 'Class'.  I
was just exposed to writing class and graphics in python in this course which
I really appreciated. I like everything about the Course Content; it really
exposed me. Well, I would like to improve on graphics and on writing Classes.

                    The course has truely been an eye-opener for me as a amateur python
programmer.  I've had limited exposure to writing python programmes and this
course greatly broadened my scope of knowledge in python.  It didn't turn me
into a seasoned programmer but I benefited enormously from it.  For one I
realised my codes are often too complicated, although they work they pose more
difficulty in debugging and improving.  Another being python's capability to
build beautiful programmes with UI.  For a long time I've only used python to
write simple scripts and thought feature rich software is reserved for C++.
Now I'm keen to continue building more programmes in python.  I am truely
thankful to the professors for putting this course up.

                    I got an introduction to Python, exactly as promised. I would have like a bit
more instruction about the standard libraries and a bit less about
CodeSkulptor, which I probably won't use again, but that's more of a nit. The
instructors were pleasant to listen to and engaging in their presentation.
Very worthwhile course, unless you're at an extreme -- either you don't know
or really care about learning a computer language, or you insist on having an
in-depth, hardcore introduction to the complexities and subtleties of Python.
For the 98% in the middle, it's a great course.

growing within the industry. I think the format of this class was done
extremely well and the team of teachers from Rice have really tried hard to
make this class not only educational, but fun! The community approach, the

                    I have taken multiple Coursera Classes on multiple topics, I would not
hesitate to say that this is one of the best classes that I have taken.  
I  was eager to get to the next lesson and do the assignments and quizzes.  
The Quizzes were very good and taught a lot.  
The Assignments were perfect, what I liked the most was the methodical way
they were explained without giving away the answers.  
  
Pros: Fantastic program, nice way to learn python...you build a game at the
end of it which is very gratifying.  
  
Cons: Its too addictive...you get hooked on to it, and wish this course was
for another 8 weeks building more  games....you don't want it  to end :-)  
  
The only improvement that comes to my mind, is to get some sort of   ""find"" (
like a Cntr-F"" functionality in the CodeSkulptor, this will ease the
programming in CodeSkulptor.

                    I found much more than I expected. It was very hard to keep up with the
lessons and end the mini-projects in due time.

I didn't imagine that a single course could be enough to learn to make such
nice games.

Now I intend to re-examine all the videos and all the other material like
practice exercises, concepts and examples to fully understand and what
happened in the last 9 weeks. It all passed before my eyes  like a rocket and
I could grab only a small part  of it :o)

I appreciated a lot the forum community and all the nice and helpful people
that posted in it. Without the help of many I wouldn't have finished the last

                    I enjoyed almost everything about this class. The browser based CodeSkultor
was fantastic, as it allowed me to take my code wherever I wanted to (I edited
it over lunch at work several times!) The class involved a fair amount of
corny ""professor"" humor which lightened the mood for such an intensive
subject. The only change I would like to see made is the inclusion of more
optional components in the mini projects - something to really challenge quick
learners or advanced students more, while not penalizing other students. Great
class though! Have highly recommended it to my friends!

                    I expected to learn some basic concept of Python language.

I like miniprojects in this course. Every miniproject is a simple game which
you need to implement. At the final you will create ""Asteroids"".

Also I like possibility to write and execute python code inside browser. I
think Codesculptor is key feature of this course. I like python manual within
Codesculptor . I use it as a reference and after the course was ended.

I would additionally highlighted part about using the debugger within
Codesculptor.

                    Fantastic class. I've taken other Coursera classes and they were too remedial
or the projects were just not fun. This class however is quite challenging but
very rewarding. You're actually given the steps (pseudo code via straight
English) to accomplish writing of your own games without given the full source
code. It's fun and extremely educational. I never thought I'd be able to write
my own Asteroid game but I did! I look forward to the next course from Rice
and these same instructors.

                    It was great learning Interactive python, the discussion forums were very
helpful.

I think it was the CODESKULPTOR which was the heart of this course, thanks a
lot Rice University, especially sir Scott Rixner.

nothing has to be improved, everything is just fine. Just introduce students
to form a group, so that their doubts can be cleared much more specifically.

                    Expected to get an intro on Python. Got this.

Like to see more on using data frames, arrays and Quant analytics. This is
more relevant to my area of work. The focus of this course is Game
programming. At some point in the course it will be great to see two different
streams of choice - data analytics and another for Games etc. perhaps there
could be more branches to pick to pursue individual focus.

                    I expected to learn a new programing language, to get a better knowledge of
event driven and object oriented programming. Also wanted to try programming
some games. I am glad that I have been able to meet my objectives in a great
extent. My only point is that sometimes I didn't have enough time to spend in
all the activities. Maybe possible shorten some videos or quizes. It would be
better for people with short time to spend like me. This has been a great
course and a good learning (at least for me).

                    The content was a little basic for me, but then I programme in C and C++
professionally, I have scripted in Perl for several years, and before the
course I started using Python at work, too. I had hoped to get a bit of
insight into some more ""Pythonic"" ways of approaching scripting in the class,
as well as developing my (mostly non-existent) skills in interactive
programming.

The former goal - about being more ""Pythonic"" -  was only partly achieved, but
I think that was just due to the intended audience.  

The second goal - improving my interactive programming skills - got a good
workout from this class.  

Overall, it was good fun, and it fostered a great community in the forums
discussing the ins and outs of how to approach the various ""mini-projects"",
and was where I probably got the most out of the class.

                    This is not what I was exactly looking for. I was after a course more focused
on programming for math and sciences. Nevertheless, had a very basic
background and this gave me lots of tools

                    I expected to get a general idea of writing programs in Python. I must admit,
it was not the first time I've taken this course, but it's only this time that
I've finished it. I think this course might seem a bit too fast-paced for a
complete beginner. Some assignments may be really time-taking. Still, it's
quite realistic to complete this course and learn really helpful things.
What's very important is that the course contains very instructive nice
practice exercises, which help to digest new material and later implement it
in either a course project or for your own needs.

It's hard to say what I actually disliked. It's easier to say what, to my
mind, could be improved. I think, the set of practice exercises could be
extended. Also, it might be a good idea to add more information on further
learning prospects at the end of the course. True, it's just the first part of
a longer specialisation, but still, I think, it could provide a better vision
of prospects and opportunities for those who are really new to programming.

                    The course content is quite comprehensive but I wish it had included the
following bits:

1\. some object oriented design (a  few  simple examples related to some of
the projects would do)  

2\. use of inheritance or some other way to reuse code (for instance could the
class Sprite have been a super class of Ship, i.e. making  Ship a kind of
""driven"" Sprite as opposed to ""timed"" Sprite...or maybe I am talking
nonsense?)

3\. using some IO methods to read configuration files (online) that could be
used to define different initial conditions. As we are using CodeSkulptor it
is not possible to open/close local files but some wrapper-class would have
been used to fake that functionality. (just a thought)  

4\. What about using some virtual appliance, this way everybody is in sync
with applications, environmnet. I assume people that are taking this course
are  also capable of downloading and running a virtual machine.

                    I thought we would learn about standard Python gaming libraries. While the
course uses a custom library for learning about GUI programming and
interactive design, the libraries and concepts used in the course are still
valuable. I have been able to take lessons that I learned in the course and
transfer them over to learning about more standard Python libraries.

Liked:

Instructors - Every instructor for this course does an excellent job teaching.
They make engaging videos and offer help and feedback through the forums.

Assignments - The assignments offer enough of a challenge, but can be
completed using the concepts from class.

Tools - codeskultpor.org made completing work for this course easy. I could
work on assignments from anywhere with web access.

  

Disliked:

Duration - I wish the course was longer and continued on to more in-depth
topics.

  

Would improve:

I would cover more material during the course and maybe make some assignments
slightly more challenging. The assignments have templates, which is useful,
but I feel like students can learn more from having to start with less code.

                    I expected to learn Python, which i did, and at the same time the game part
was appealing to me too.

I liked everything.

Maybe i would increase the difficulty of the mini-projects by not giving away
every little step (even though there was a big range of people where some had
programming abilities already and others didnt).

                    I learned more than I expected, it was kind of a jump-start into programming
in Python. While the course is built on a course-specific Python shell, still
it's a powerful introduction into the world of Python. Excellent course for
beginners and programmers alike.

                    This was a great introduction and the deadlines made you stay the course.  My
fundamental problem with this course is probably applicable to all online
education, in that the feedback loop is slow and problematic when there are
deadlines.  Support based on the forum method are highly problematic as the
quality of the posts vary in quality, and if the threat is poor, it will lead
you further away from the correct solution.  I think some sort of textbook
would be helpful.  Overall, good course and I learned a lot.  However, there
were some serious flaws that are endemic to online learning.  

For those who think this can be circumvented through meetup groups, I live
across the river from NYC (i.e. a presumable large population of other
codeskulpters) and it didn't meet up once.   Relying on meetups as a form of
study group is not reliable as it would be in theory.

That being said, this is the best online programming course that I have been
able to find.

                    I already have some experience in programming C++ and Java. I wanted to learn
a scripting language that was the reason I took this course. My plan was to
attend few video lectures and drop out.  But once I started doing, I enjoyed
so much I decided to complete.   I have to say big thank to Scott and Joe for
that. I really love you guys. You are excellent teachers.  

  

I will not recommend any major changes  as this course is perfect. Only one
suggestion I have is  that if time permits may be add a simple assignment to
do using actual Python instead of CodeSkulptor.

                    I expected to learn a bit about programming in python. But I learned a great
deal more than I had bargained for. The assignments and quizes were
challenging to a newbie like me, but the course had a really good pace and
reasonable level of difficulty. I felt stretched but never overwhelmed. I had
a great time.

My only suggestion for improvement is better instruction on how to transition
from CodeSkulptor to something like TKinter. Because now I'm eager to build my
own programs.

                    I wanted to learn how to use python in simple game development and this course
was a great intro.  The pace is steady.  There is a lot of material to absorb
and apply each week, but between the lecture videos, practice exercises, and
forum, all the help is there to get it done.  If the pace was a little slower
or if the course added an extra week or two in the middle to try some practice
exercises, etc. that would be helpful.  Overall it was a really great course!

                    I expected like other courses to get lost fast but the discussion groups were
a great help to me. Others were having the same type of problems that I was
having and others where encouraging and suggesting things to try. Made me feel
less the programming idiot and enabled me to get most of the concepts.

My only wish would be to have more tutorials on using Viz mode as I really
couldn't follow it.

Overall great class. While difficult for me, very, very rewarding. I felt like
I accomplished something in programming. Thanks!

people with strong programming background, due to time limitations i felt
rushed at times and had not enough time to absorb the material.

                    What did you expect to learn?I took this class to improve my understanding of
the python programing language. My goal was to learn how to utilize python
with a GUI interface. Improving my understanding of python while programing
games was just a bonus.

What did you like and dislike?Over thinking a problem that only requires a
simple solution. The class gets you to think, and that is a good thing!

What would you improve?  
The class feels polished, so this question is hard to answer. Also the
Instructors actively updated quizzes when there was confusion with what was
being asked. I would suggest as an improvment would be to increase the pool of
questions that are used to generate the quizes. This way when retaking the
quiz there are different questions. The number of questions is good. Making
the student work for the correct answer is good.  And having different
questions each time a quiz is retaken I feel would bring a better barometer of
the students understanging of the material.

                    I wanted to gain more experience programming in python to help position myself
for data analyst/data scienctist jobs, and for the fun of it.

The focus on actually coding really well thought-out projects as the main
means of learning was spot-on. The lectures and quizzes were well tailored to
give you the knowledge base needed for the week's project. If you have more
experience with programming, you might resent some of the hand-holding, but
you probably shouldn't be taking this class then. OR, you still might enjoy
yourself, since you build some pretty fun games (pong, asteroids, blackjack)
as a part of the course!!!

The material is mainly aimed towards building interactive applications (GUI's,
games). This is not the direction I intend to take python programming in the
future, but despite that mismatch, I still found this an excellent class,
since it was actually fun to work on the projects. That means I was motivated
to practice the basics of coding in python every week, meaning that after 8
weeks, I feel MUCH more comfortable and competent with python. Cheers Scott,
Joe, John, and Stephen!!!

                    I expected to learn the fundamentals of Python to the level of being
conversant enough in the language to be able to learn more about it, and I
did. I liked that we programmed games because it was fun, but I wish we had
also had the chance to write Web-based programs that were more typical of what
would be required in the real world (e.g. business-type systems using
databases). I liked most aspects of the class except the use of simplegui
(which was OK, but it would have been helpful to have used a commercial
package) and peer assessment. I understand the need for using both of these
and would not expect them to change. What might be a good idea for future
improvement is for at least one of the ""peer"" reviewers to be a TA who is
experienced in Python. I have no concept of how many students were enrolled in
the course, so this might not be practical if there were many. I would
definitely recommend the course to anyone who has a programming background who
wants to become conversant in Python. I would be hesitant to recommend the
course to someone who has never programmed in any language before or to anyone
who has difficulty understanding mathematics.

learn a lot about SimpleGUI, and in the process learn some problem solving

                    I've been self learning Python (and programming in general) for about 6
months. I had enough python experience when I started this class to cruise
through the programming concepts. However, I learned a TON about building a
game. The math involved has always eluded me, but now I'm ready to take on
some projects that I'm excited about. Thanks to Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen
I wouldn't have the tools at this point to confidently start some pygame
projects that I think my kids will enjoy. Can't wait for the next class from
them.

                    I expected to learn a routine for programming in Python and also to understand
the basic concepts and ways of doing things in OO programming. I didn't like
the Viz mode so much, never used it. It felt like it was a big extra chunk of
learning to do before I could get a hang of it. So I used the time to learn
the things by reading the docs and experimenting with CodeSculptor. It was a
nice thing to have the speed up button for the video classes, since sometimes
the tempo was a little slow for me, however, I believe the tempo must have
been ok for those with less or no experience in programming in general.

it the right way, and you would like to compare to intructors' implementation.

like this in the virtual world then we probably need to question why we need

                    I really loved the first 3/4 of the class. It moved at a nice, even pace and,
while challenging, was still very understandable. Once we got into objects,
however, it was really hard to keep up. I would have liked some sort of
textbook or better handouts to help with understanding things. If I wanted to
teach myself with Python docs, I would've done so. The documentation for Code
Skulptor was really good, but, again, didn't do much to teach concepts.

                    I expected to learn the concepts of object oriented programming in python and
that's exactly what I learned.  While it would be possible to learn this
writing boring programs - this class teaches OOP using small games...   It was
fun!

I disliked .... hmm...   I really didn't dislike anything about the class.

The only thing I would like to see improved (if it could be) would be file
handling in CodeSkulptor.   When the class was done I had a huge number of
saved links - each a different version of the games I had worked on for the
class.  It would be really nice if there was a login page where you could save
the files.

                    I expected to get into game programming with Python and I got that. The
content was very good for a beginner's course. I already knew some Python but
I considered working through even the most basic stuff a useful exercise.

At times, I felt that the project templates perhaps provided too much help
making the project feel a bit too easy but as some of the students perhaps
didn't have the programming background, this was perhaps necessary.

A follow-up course perhaps by using some existing library like PyGame, Cocos2d
or similar would be very interesting.

                    I actually learned a lot more than I expected and and enjoyed it to the point
that I have taken steps to further improve my skill set and knowledge in the
subject.  I have converted the programs that we developed online down to my
local laptop and have continued to work on them, making improvements and
tweaking them.

I was surprised at the range of experience of students in the class (from just
beginning to experienced developers who were looking to learn a new language)
and how helpful everyone was to each other in figuring problems or
understanding concepts.  It felt very friendly and supportive all the way
around from the students up to the professors.

I would definitely take more courses from these guys whether they were in my
career path or not, just because they made learning something new very fun and
easy to do.

                    I am impressed that I finished the course and have done all the quizzes and
the mini-projects! I have to say that I can't accomplish this without the well
explained lecture and the help from our TA.

Some of the mini-projects were very difficult. I think it would be better to
have some more time in between some projects. So that we can get to absorb the
knowledge properly instead of looking up the definition of the functions while
I'm trying to implement the game in the projects. Saying so, it might just be
me not be able to absorb the concepts well because I didn't put enough time
into it. I'll have to watch the lectures more even the course is finished now.

It definitely was a great experience taking this course! Thank you!

The content was great and yet it could have been explained a bit more in
detail.

I would like it if there was a helpline which could be called or Skype. Though
there was a help mail available, many a times it did not serve the purpose.

                    Excellent course. I strongly recommend that you start here if you have never
programmed before. They know that most students don't have prior experience in
programming, so they organized the course in a very didactic and enjoyable
manner.  
  
While learning to program, you also get to see what can be achieved in Python,
and you have LOTS amounts of fun doing it. I think that teaching through the
process of making games was a fantastic idea. It makes you really get into it
and try different ways to face the challenges, and you learn way more doing
so.  
  
Also, the teachers are excellent, they cover everything and interact with the
students in a way I have never seen in a MOOC. It made the class seem a lot
more personal and not as formal as they usually are elsewhere. I loved all the
competitive gaming and betting between Scott and Joe, it was very fun and a
great addition to the course.  
  
Thanks for everything guys, I started without knowing what an ""if"" clause is,
and now I can design the game ""Asteroids"". Again, I strongly recommend this
course for anyone that wants to learn to program in a really enjoyable way.

                    No real expectations as such apart from learning how to code in Python.

Liked the structure of the lessons, the way all instructors taught, mini-
projects, exercises and codeclinic tips. Dislike would only be the fact that
the program templates for mini projects make it too easy most of the times :).

Like I said above, grading system should be improved. It is way too lenient
the present way.

                    I expected to learn basic Python syntax and constructs. I liked the game
programming   angle, it definitely takes the dryness out of the peer-reviews.
I would have liked to learn a little about data and files.

                    I have learnt OOP from this class which I would LOVE to explore further. I
dont get to do much OOP, but the ease of it has blown me away.

A design course - OOD would be very interesting and exciting.

I enjoyed every bit of the class and hence have nothing to dislike.

  * Unique game development each week, keeps one engaged :)
  * Professors Joe and Steve are very humorous
  * Viz tool helps you understand the program like GDB. Seems cool.

Things to improve:

  * With codeskulptor, it will be better to add capability to link multiple .py URLs and run everything as a whole. This will often be the case in a big software project when multiple files have to communicate information.
  * A little more touching on concepts of rstrip() and other similar tricks will be handy
  * A little smile from John during programming tips would have been nice :)

                    I have programmed in many other languages so I wanted an introduction to the
benefits of the Python language. I wasn't expecting to find the game
programming aspects interesting but - despite my lack of knowledge or interest
in gaming - they were. This course was fast paced and it was a struggle to
keep up with all the work - but so worth it for the sense of satisfaction at

                    It was a interesting class and the content and programming projects were
challenging enough to be make you work, but a also manageable to completed
when going through the online classes, online quizzes, and extra practice
exercises.

If getting stuck on something, the forums are very useful and both co-students
and TAs are very helpful to keep you going into right direction.

The programming assignments (mini-projects) were focusing on programming some
interactive apps and tools which was fun to work on and it was also
interesting to review and assess the work of the co-students.

Personally I would have liked to also do a bit of text and file parsing and
manipulating such data, but for the rest a lot of different aspects of
scripting and programming in Python has been taught.

I would highly recommend this class if you are looking to get some hands on
interactive programming!

I think it would be better if you provide some more difficult, optional

with python"". The current exercises are fun and educational, but I think I
could learn more in each week.

                    I would've add introduction in Python such as language characteristics and
where it stands among other languages.

I would've prefer more focus on OOP.  Some how-tos on writing classes. OOP was
introduced in the end of the course and most of it wasn't to be learnt from
own experience but rather given in templates ready for use. So I got a feeling
like understanding classes was somewhat from second hand experience (not done
on own but just to be understood from ready examples)

I liked everything, except I think it's a bit too hard for me - just for me.

                    I expected to learn how to program in Python and the course succeeded in
helping me reach that goal.  The projets were easy to complete but most of all
FUN as I can now play each of the games afterward and 'tweak' them to add more
complex behaviors if I wish.

I  really felt this was the best online course of this type I have EVER taken
and am looking forward to investigating future course offerings.

                    Overall good introductory class but I would have liked if we were asked to
write code using our own editor and local Python interpreter.  We can use
codeskulptor as a tool to debug code but not THE tool to both write code and
debug it.  The codeskulptor is a great tool and made my life much easier but
it also have disadvantages of not learning things as we might in real life.

  

The course overall seemed easy, may be due to my CS background.   I do not
know if it taught me everything I need to learn about programming in Python.
The course was too focus on getting graphical interface going which is not bad
but some other real like examples such as writing a script would have been a
great addition to the course.   Also, I was hoping for some exposure to
recursive calls etc. but I guess those are left to advance course.  

  

But overall great course.  Keep more coming!

                    I expected to learn the basics of Python which I did. There are a few things I
didn't learn which I had learnt from other places, but there are also a lot of
things which I didn't realize I didn't know about.

I liked the quizzes because I found they forced you to understand the material
more deeply than if you just watched the videos and did the mini projects. I
also like the effort Joe and Scott put into making the videos fun and
interesting.

There is a focus on making games with the miniprojects, which I personally
don't necessarily find more interesting than making other programs, but I'm
guessing a lot of people do.

                    An excellent introductory course to Python and programming in general.
However, the fact that it was introductory did not mean it was simple. We were
coding from the first week in and I felt challenged at all times. There were a
couple of projects I struggled to finish but i *did* finish, which is kind of
the hallmark of a well-taught course. It should be hard but not impossible.
That's the way this course is. Highly recommended.

                    Programming games, which I did. The teachers are really fun, the projects are
compelling, CodeSkulptor is really practical.  There's nothing in particular
that I don't like but my own lazyness to overdedicate in order to become a
real good programmer faster. I don't if it would be possible for beginners in
this course, but I'd would've liked to get some insight on working with 3D
games, if possible.

                    I found this class to be very helpful and fun. I have been programming for
many years (over 30), but usually only learn enough to do what I need to do.
This class exposed me to a new type of programming (games) and taught me
several useful tidbits that I was previously unaware of and likely would not
have picked up without the class. The instructors are very good and the class
is taught in a way that programmers of all levels can gain something from. I
highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning Python and/or
about interactive game programming.

building some games.

  

I liked the CodeSkulptor tool. Very interative and makes the experience of
coding much more fun.

  

The course was amazing in every way.

  

I feel pretty confidant to build programs using python language. I was not
expecting learn so much about the python language and also the tips provided
in the 'Programming Tips' made me change some bad habits that I used to have.

  

Anyways, as I already have a bachelor in computer science I was not expecting
learn so much in this course but the course exceeded my expectations. I will
certainly recommend this course as well as the university to my buddies.

                    The amount of work needed can be a lot.  One of the things about coding is
that you can spend a long time on a small problem that keeps you from
progressing.

Having test questions that include the need to complete code are good, but it
would be nice to separate and identify them. A couple of times I attempted to
complete quizzes on my phone but I can't do the coding on it.  The week I
needed to do that each quiz had one or two questions the required needed
coding.

                    I wanted to dive into object oriented programming and I've been served!! Now
I've got a better understanding of the possibilities of this way of thinking
anf I really would like to continue learning about programming in Python.

If I had something to improve, it would be the speed of Joe Warren when he
speaks. I'm French speaker and I wouldn't understand anything if there
wouldn't have been subtitles.

                    The course progressed in terms of difficulty quite quickly.  I was able to
complete the first couple projects relatively quickly and with relatively
little difficulty.  But things did get challenging about 4 weeks in and I
found that the amount of time I had to invest was considerably greater than I
anticipated. when I signed up.  In the end, this wasn't a bad thing...it's
good to be challenged but those that are thinking this is  commitment of just
a few hours a week may end up getting surprised!

                    I expected to learn Python and to write a simple video game.  I learned
perhaps a simplified version of Python suitable for a beginner, but the games
we learned to write were actually more complex and fun than I had expected.
There was nothing I didn't like about this class.  Even the schedule was well
organized.  Projects were due on the weekend but lectures, quizzes and so on
were available far enough in advance that I was able to complete everything
during the week and therefore go away on weekends for some previously planned
trips.  Similarly the grading was due on Wednesday morning so I was able to
get back from even a three day weekend and still complete the required peer
grading.  (all times USA).

                    I was expecting to learn how to code in python of course. I also expected it
to drag somewhat, but was surprised when in week 5 I was still just as eager
to move on as I was in week 1. I liked how the instructors kept everything
moving at a good pace. High quality course, would definitely recommend to
anyone interested in learning python.

                    Expected to learn the basics of Python programming and that was met plus some.
Liked all things mentioned above like codeskulptor, videos, exercises and
forums. The guys did a really great job in their explanations and threw in
some banter and joking around as well.

I would include some marking to be included for game playability - sometimes
students mini project games were difficult to play/unplayable but the fixed
rubric meant they scored 100%. I would like to be able to give someone with a
perfect game a better score than someone who's game is unplayable.

Apart from that, a really great course and highly recommended for learning the
basics.

                    As a beginner, I find this class very tough. I spent almost 24 hours to finish
each miniproject from week 5 onwards. To ""perfect"" the quizzes, I spent about
1 hr per quizz, and more for the quizz on building class. Even though I have
not expected to spend so much time, I really enjoyed the video classes and the
discussion forum . I think the class material is very well organized and well
thought. In my opinion, Codeskulptor really accelerates the programming in
Python learning experience. I'm planning to write some simple games from the
skills I've learned from this course.  I hope that I'll be advanced enough to
transition to using the actual Python program. The Introduction to Python team
is very creative in structuring their quizzes and projects to affirm what you
have learned in the class videos. I also enjoy the video tutorial competition
very much. I'm not advanced enough to make and give a tutorial but I've
learned so much just by watching them. Credits to the course creators and team
who have come up with this idea. Great work! Great course! For those of you
who have no programming experience like me, if you are willing to spend the
time, don't hesitate to join this course! If I can do it, you can! Thank you,

                    Content was 5/5.  I never programmed with GUI before (only behind the scenes
data processing stuff well and internet stuff which does have an interface
although very different in implementation).  I've also never programmed games
before so it was a different way of thinking and I really enjoyed the math
part of the course as calculating financial information math is very different
so this was fun for me.

What I didn't like a small part of is the self-assessment process.  It was
often without comments from other students and I suspect most students didn't
look at the code, only the final implementation.  So for example I noticed
after I submitted my code where I mistakenly updated my draw functions more
than once per cycle.  I still had normal gameplay because I adjusted my
constants to make everything work well.  But no one noticed.  I also made
heavy use of John's list comprehension (filtered and computational) to reduce
the amount of code and duplicate code.  Based on the lack of comments I don't
even think people looked at the code.  I think if grade was based on at least
one question per assignment having us look for something in the code that once
we were there looking we'd learn even more things.  I don't know if Coursrea
could handle a non-point awarding questions but even asking a simple question
of how many lines of code without comments did the program have would force us
to look at people's code.  Our own natural curiosity would have us looking
more deeply if one person's code is 100 lines more (or less) to see why that
is.  I would say I'm an advanced programmer and I still learned lots by
looking at other's code so was a little disappointed when most my assessments
came back with no meaningful comments.

                    The course is gradually getting harder close to the end. I am glad that  I did
not give up when I could hardly find sufficient time for the mini-project. I
love the course provided by Rice University. Some Python courses on the
Internet are too easy, you cannot learn much from there. This course is
different. I really benefit from the course. I am comfortable to write python
scripts at work now.  Thanks for your excellent work.

                    Well, it did what it said on the tin!

We might have had two project assignments for the first introduction to OOP,
which I found very difficult at first.

I would like to see John Greiner's implementation of the projects after the
deadline, as his code style was superb, i.e. model answers! Coding style is
important, and I'm notoriously bad at it!

                    While I loved the Course itself, as I have full time job which also requires
occasional travelling, sometimes I just did not have enough time to complete
specially weekly mini projects or even had to rush with the quizes. It turned
out this Course does require at least 10 hours of your time per wekk (unless
you already have some pre knowledge). Still, I managed to lear more than
couple of new things I will try to use in the future. Thank You Joe, Scott,
John and Stephen!!!

                    Great class.  I think it did an excellent job of teaching the fundamentals
that it needed to do.  For a truly novice with zero experience it may very
well be overwhelming.

Would love a 2nd class that is all about OOP, not using globals and writing
better code.

But if you are like me with some programming experience this class will leave
you with a good understanding of enough to move on.

                    pros:  
  
course is good for major IT audience.  
  
You will learn how to program in Python 2.6 interactive apps, event driving
concept.  
  
basic data types and operations.  
  
cons;  
  
It has Math. Personally I hate math and everything related (e.g. geometry). It
has it a LOT.  
  
I spent nights solving geometry physics problems in this course, instead of
learning real python! :(  
  
They should replace math with coverage of basic python API and programming
paradigms , PATTERNS!  
  
And it feels better if you familiar with any other OOP language!

  

the only motivation for it - certificate, otherwise time spent personally
would be more valuable.

it was fully worth it. At least the work and effort invested got its rewards;
I feel now much better able to code in Python, even if I still have a lot to
learn.

                    I expected technical discussions on variables, loop, conditional, etc along
with lots of on your own reading. I did not expect any object oriented
material. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the video
lectures and the fun projects. When I getting my BS degree the whole OO topic
was for grad students. This class addressed OO seemlessly and simply. I have a
full life already and each week did have more than enough material for me to
try to squeeze in. I would prefer a little more flexibilty in the schedule but
the pace of the class is good. I was expecting some exploration of the
Raspberry Pi project and anything similar. I also was expecting some
information as to why python - is it popular in a specific industry - what are
its advantages over other languages? I live in the USA but one of my coworkers
in Europe loves python and talks about how common it is in the financial
industry there. I feel like I have added a tool to my toolbox but I'm not sure
if / when I'll ever use it.

                    First, I just wanted to learn to code in Python and that's all. However, after
two or three weeks every new lecture I was eager to watch the mini-project
video just because it's fun! Learning Python started being a side-effect...
:))

I enjoyed following their lecture videos as much as watching The Big Bang
Theory on TV, specially the mini-project videos!! The best ones: ""Pong, Memory
and Spaceship (with Mike's guest appearance)!  

For a complete begginer in CS, the last weeks might be a bit of a challenge...

two weeks should've been elaborated more. There should have been one more
project in between the last two classes to help understand classes more.

                    I wanted to learn the basics of getting up and running in Python and this
class succeeds in doing that.  Building functioning games to teach the correct
syntax, structure and concepts of Python is a great way to keep students
engaged in the material.  I highly recommend this class to anyone interested
in getting started with Python.

  

My only minor complaint was that week 4 is pretty stressful to complete within
the time-frame given.  I easily put in 3 to 4 hours per day the entire week
towards the material in week 4.  I also work full time so that's basically
every night after work.  Blackjack introduced new concepts that I really
struggled to get working in my mini-project.  I relied heavily on the forums
to get the project completed and I literally finished it about 30 minutes
before the deadline.  That being said I did get it working and the remaining
projects were not as difficult in week's 5 and 6.

  
Great class, two thumbs up. :)

                    I expected to learn how to program in Python; an added benefit was learning
more about Object Oriented Programming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the class and
the projects.  The instructors were fun and explained the content well, not
leaving me to explore the web for answers, as some of the other online classes
I have taken require.  I think the course is suitable for beginners as well as
more advanced programmers.  Although it was presented with enough detail that
a beginner would be able to understand the content, I rarely felt like I
skipping over content because it was too elementary for me, even though I am a
professional programmer.  I heartily recommend this class to anyone who enjoys
or wants to learn about programming, whether beginner or advanced.

                    It is an introductory course, so it doesn't go too deep. However, it teaches a
lot of things in a very pleasant manner. Everyone is very helpful and it seems
like the instructors have put a lot of work in it. Overall it is a well
structured introductory course in python, which I would recommend to anyone
who wants to start learning python.

                    i expected to get some experience on Python for my work, and i think it gave
me security to write my codes (but we don't use GUIs)

  

i liked the fact that the course is very dynamic, but it took me more hours i
expected (it is not bad from the course perspective)

  

i would improve a few videos, where on situations of sharing the screen (like
showing some text or codeskulptor screen), makes the sound very very low...
but with earphones it got better :-)

  

thank you guys for this amazing job

                    I expected to learn some basic graphical programming and I did.  If you had
asked me at the start of the course to make an Asteroids like game i would not
have known where to start, but by the end of the class I had successfully
completed the project.  I liked the quiz/mini-project format.  It is much
better than exams (for me at least) because you get to show what you learned
in code you created.  The only thing I wish there was more of is additional or
more comprehensive reference material to help when trying to figure out how
things work.

                    I have taken a bunch of MOOCs at this point and this is by far the best one I
have participated in.  The course is very well  structured and very well
taught.  The instructors obviously put in a a lot of time into this course.
I came in as a novice python programmer with limited programming experience
overall and the course was perfectly paced for me.    I finish this course
with the confidence to continue programming in python and really couldn't have
asked for more form this class.  I hope the instructors continue with this
course and maybe even develop some more courses to build on the skills learned
in this course.

                    I expected to learn to program in Python.  What I like is that they developed
our understanding of Object Oriented Programming and our skills in how to
approach programming tasks in general.  They provide enough scaffolding and
support that everyone can succeed, but have made it sufficiently challenging
that real learning takes place.  Plus, they clearly care about and enjoy what
they are doing and that comes through in the videos.  And, they have a quirky
sense of humor which is fun to watch.  You will have to work hard in this
class, but will feel proud of your accomplishments if you stick with it.
Having completed this course, I feel ready for a higher level challenge.

                    Fantastic course! The class taught the basics of Python very well, and the
focus on games made the projects we made extra interesting. The difficulty was
perfect for me; I've dabbled in programming before, but I've never taken a
structured course in Python. The instruction was clear and useful, and the
quizzes and projects were just difficult enough that we had to put real
thought into them, but well-explained so they didn't become frustrating. I do
wish we had more of a chance to get our code itself peer-reviewed instead of
just the final product, but the limits of a MOOC make that difficult.

                    So much of learning how to code, is to just code. So one improvement I would
suggest, would be to better incorporate the practice exercises into the
videos. When introducing a new topic each week, devote more time in the videos
to pop-up quizzes and sample coding exercises. This will help to more closely
connect theory and practice.

                    I expected to learn Python, and feel like I have a good understanding of what
was focused on.  I think I would like a better understanding on the language
syntax.  At times I would see some very cleaver ways of doing things with
conditionals, and loops, but I didn't have time to figure them out.  Overall,
I felt the course was worth the time, and would recommend it to anyone wanting
to learn Python.

Python, which was subject of this course. But I highly appreciate introduction
to simple GUI.

For me personally were pretty challenging sometimes tight deadlines.
Especially when I moved during a course for a week abroad for holiday. But
significantly helped the possibility to download videos and see them off-line

Great class for beginners...Will not be boring as you will be applying
whatever you learn in very interactive and interesting ways. The course is
very well structured and challenges you just enough to make you break a sweat
at the same time betters your programming thought process.

                    I expected to learn some more basic stuff that I've overseen while just
picking up the language 4-5 years ago. It gave me a lot more than just some
basics, and I have discovered a whole new power to Python.

I liked everything, and the only thing I would improve if I had the right
wand, was to make a part two with more stuff. I could watch these guys for a
long time, being entertained while learning cool stuff.

                    I had previous experience programming in other languages but never Python. I
expected to learn Python syntax and methods, and I did - I now have a
foundation for more advanced Python programming. The lectures were excellent,
the mini-projects were enjoyable and just the right level of challenging and
do-able if you follow the lectures and the templates and instructions. The
documentation, forums, and extra materials (exercises, sample programs) were
also excellent - there when you needed them, but out of the way when you
didn't.

course had very good lectures, projects and a very prompt discussion forum(I
haven't seen these many threads / quick response time in other courses). This
is one course to date that I learned just because it was so FUN!!  
  
I started one week late, missed first mini-project deadline but was still able
to complete rest of the course successfully - thanks to the great lectures and
reading materials!  
  
Looking forward to next set of courses from these instructors!

                    I think I learned more than expected - I have done Python courses for
beginners before, so I expected this course to be more of the same (I did it
mainly for the practice). But I learned a lot of useful things that I didn't
know before, not only about Python itself, but also object-oriented
programming.

CodeSculptor, the browser-based programming environment used in the course,
made learning basics a lot more fun than it usually is. Great kudos to Scott
for creating it and to John for making the documentation so easy to navigate
and read. I hope CodeSkulptor will be up and developed in the future!

The peer assessment was another very nice thing about this course. I could
compare my code and solutions to those written by others. I could also learn
how different it is to debug someone else's code comparing to debugging your
own, and some design decisions and standards make a lot more sense now. I
shouldn't forget, of course, to mention the valuable feedback that I have
received from my peers.

I would perhaps make quizzes and self-assessment optional rather than
obligatory (for such practical skills as programming), but that's just an
idea.  

Overall, thank you very much, lecturers and all the people more or less
directly involved in creating this course!

                    The 'CodeSkulptor' web programming framework was the 'candy' that got me to
take this course. Great Job! I expected to learn game programming principles
and implementation in python. I got all of that and even learned some things
about python I had been able to avoid until now. Thank you also for doing some
of the 'heavy lifting' in the later projects. I think I could have figured out
how to do the whole thing, but learning to use the objects you provided
instead of my own was quite instructive. It also made it feasible to finish
the projects in the time given.

The only improvement I would suggest would be more demonstrations of how to
use the CodeSkulptor Viz mode to do troubleshooting  in the more complicated
projects later in the course  would be helpful (it become quite busy and hard
to follow) for me. I would also like more information on transitioning beyond
Code Skulptor.  Scott gave some good pointers in the post-class video, but one
or two examples of transitioning to a different GUI could be helpful. However
I now feel confident to take on that challenge for myself. I could be
'dangerous'!

                    Course content was greatly designed. I have a fair amount of professionally
working with Java, I found that from week 4 on-wards the course got bit
demanding and more fun at the same time. If you plan to complete the course,
please put dedicated and serious effort, its not hard but not that easy to
catch up either if you do it leisurely.

Highly recommended class for serious Python learners.

                    I thought by the end of the class I would have a very limited and basic
knowledge of Python.  However, I found that my knowledge was vast.  The fact
that I could build upon the previous week really helped to keep me engaged and
become a much better programmer.  I was able to learn each concept well before
moving on.

                    1\. I expected to learn basics of Python.

2\. I liked the lectures of the course and content as well. The description of
the course shows that it is about creating games which is a great fun. A range
of topics is covered, including some examples of classes.

3\. I would take another course in Python from Rice University about
algorithms, data structures, simulations. But it is another course, not this
one. So, everything is great!

                    I expected to learn what programming is, and use Python as the first
programming language to get my feet wet. With this class I learned how to
program and realized that I really like it. I didn't know that I could program
games myself and felt very accomplished every time that I finished a project.
The lectures were fun and motivating. And I wish there was courses of
different level to follow up.

                    I expected to refresh or relearn the fundamentals of programming -- Done.

how to better approach a problem and write better and reusable code -- Done.

Improvements:

  Codeskulptor with IDE like features.

What i would like to have in future:

  Advanced concepts like designing modular programs, multithreading,
algorithms...etc.

  

Overall a truly amazing course.

Love to see more.

                    Overall, pretty good course. I don't think we really got to see best
practices, necessarily, particularly from a gamedev perspective. I wish the
final project had been more feature-complete, too. That said, this course is a
reasonably good toewetting experience with Python that I'd recommend to
others.

                    I expected to learn some basic Python programming. I never imagined to learn
such nicely about object oriented programming and some basic GUI.

I liked the amount of material covered every week. I was well balanced between
challenging/entertaining and achievable.  I liked also that I could start
directly with the programming part if I felt confident, still when I stuck the
practical examples and the forum/tips were able to help me out.

I can highly recommend this particular course at Coursera. Compare to other
courses I am already following this is clearly the best.

                    I expected the course to teach Python in a way that was suitable for
beginners.   As someone with a lot of programming experience and a year or so
of Python use, I have to say that it fell short of that.   Complete beginners
to programming would have found the pace too quick and the breadth to which
Python was explained was too narrow.

However, as a beginners course in event-driven programming, it was absolutely
superb - I learned a lot and enjoyed the course immensely.  

In view of the mismatch between my expectations and what was delivered, I have
decided to grade the course content on what was provided - hence the five
stars.  

Well done all of you who put this course together.

                    I personaly expected building interactive programs but not the game types.

However i enjoyed the course and learned not only the basics of python but
very advanced features like  

oo-programming.  

Maybe next time the course is launched a blending of game and/or more
""practical"" (i do not mean that

building games is not practical) programs would be useful

                    I learnt a lot of new things (programming language, problem solving
techniques, thinking alternatives, &c.

I like the way the basic and fundamental concepts of programming (e.g., data
structures) are presented and practiced by games (we love games from child).

                    At a first glance one would expect to learn a programming language in a
environment closer to the one used in a day-to-day basis, but I believe that
the fact that the teachers chose to teach the language in a more controlled
environmet worked perfectly. In the end they managed to deliver all of the
necessary knowledge to be proficient in python with a very simple tool
(codeskulptor) that helps eliminate the clutter of setting up the development
box in the first place, and alows you to go head first into the course
materials from day one.

I think I learned enough to start having python as na extra tool in my
solution toolbox.

                    I learned what I expected to learn. Granted, with this being more of an entry-
level course, there is a ways yet to go. I liked the pace of the class and in
some parts, I though it could have been sped up a little bit, particularly in
the beginning. After completing the course, the content was fantastic,
lectures were engaging.

  

One thing that I would like to see in future classes would be in addition to a
mini-project each week, there is an overall project to be completed as well.
It needs to be separate from the mini-projects, but the concepts learned that
week could be applied. I believe that would assist the students in getting
used to development is not an overnight process.

                    I expected to learn a lot of Python. Finally, I have learned how to create
several kind of games in Python.

I like the course, but I expected to learn how to manage databases, or files,
or sessions, or cookies, etc.

I think the course should be more generalistic, it has been too much pointed
to the game creation, not to the basis of Python.

course was just perfect for someone like me, who have some previous experience

I liked how effective was the course at dealing with the difficult task of
teaching programming to someone without much experience, and how with a little
time investment I could feel myself more and more confident with the code I
write.

To mention something, I would like if they might improve the simpleGUI module.
It's a bit limitating as it don't have that many features, but as a learning
tool it's good enough, to be true.

                    The course was very good. I am new in proramming , I wanted something good for
repeating basics of programming. I found it in this course.

There was also new information which I haven't learned yet, like classes.
Doing mini- projects based on it was hard.  ""Practice and help""  part of the
course helped very much.

 So, the course is really good.  For me this course took a lot of time and
work, and if you're also new to programming, be ready to it. And it worth it
if you really want to learn.

                    This is a great course for python beginners. The best part i like is
miniproject. It provides us with a good chance to share and review our
programs. Comments from peers are encouraging, especially when you get
complimentary feedback. The materials are not comperhensive but rather
practical. It teaches gui programming very early so students can quickly write
interesting codes at the beginning.  
The course provides you with a basic online  ide called codeskluptor. It's
both easy and powerful to beginners. It's an awesome tool for python learner.
The only problem is that it doesn't support python 3 and I think instead of
python 2, python 3 is a better choice to start with.

was a joy to use. Having assignments as interactive games gave a different
taste that is much better and challenging than any other course I've taken.
Peer-grading is a powerful tool that I learnt from it my mistakes instead of
correcting others.

  

Also, people working on this course including instructors, TAs and even
students were so funny, organized and helpful along the way, Thank you all.

Scott and Joe, I don't dislike anything about this course and Just add couple
off videos more or one simple game using classes before blackjack as it will
be little bit harder for beginners.

python and had no Idea about how to create a game. This course taught how i
can draw my own components using simple graphics library, and how can i make
nice animation and games. Learning this is real boot to my confidence as a
software engineer.  The course quiz and mini project assignments were really
engrossing, unlike my past college study experience completing this stuff was
more of interest then necessity.

                    Great course, I was unsure whether enrolling at the beginning and now that I
have completed the course, I am seriously glad I did it. The instructors are
great and they really make you feel as if you were in a real class. The
lessons are never boring, they always manage to keep your attention focused on
the each subject they teach and challenge you to understand it on your own
with useful exercises. Codeskulptor is great and allows you to develop your
programs, debug and run them using a web browser! It's one of the most
valuable thing that this course offers to beginners. During the course they
offer programming tips, examples and quizzes that really help understanding
the concepts and developing your skills a week after the other. I was amazed
on how quickly I managed to write more and more complex codes. You start with
a few lines code and you end up with a hundred of lines or even more. I must
also say that I remembered object programming as a very difficult topic from
school, however this course explains it so well that you realize how powerful
and great this programming style is. The peer's evaluation and self review are
really helpful and let you understand how other students dealt with the week's
mini project, and challenge you to review and evaluate your work after that.  

I must say this is an exceptional course that I would recommend to everyone,
beginners as well as advanced programmers that wants to Python, object
oriented programming and GUI based programming.

                    Course content was fantastic. Even with some previous experience with Python,
I learnt quite a lot. The assignments were fun and enjoyable enough that they
didn't really seem like a chore that i had to complete, but more like a fun
challenge that made me feel a great sense of accomplishment when done. I had
expected to brush up on concepts that i was weak on, and learn new techniques
for doing things. The course certainly gave me the opportunity to brush up my
skills, and made me aware of programming techniques that are useful, along
with techniques to avoid. It introduced me to event driven programming which
is coming in useful in other programming projects i have played around with
outside of class.

I absolutely loved this class. Teachers were awesome, content was great, it
was a lot of fun. I would definitely recommenced this to any one starting out
programming, or people with some existing experience but wanting to polish up
their programming skills.

                    The course content was brilliant! Learning Python by programming simple and
gradually more complicated games works very well. As a student I was very
motivated to complete a game and see it work and be played.  The course is not
easy but it can be completed in the required time - as a complete beginner in
Python I spent about 8 hours/week on it most weeks - more on the week that
introduced Object Orientated Programming and less in the earlier weeks.
Everything you need is included and the exercises and quizzes require you to
use the provided documentation which is a good skill to acquire anyway. The
lectures cover the material in an entertaining way and set you up for success
in the weeks mini project. I can't wait for the next course from the Rice
team!

                    I expected to learn some basics of Python and get simpliest ideas of object
oriented programming, and I was not disappointed with class.

I liked a lot of practice, learning rather difficult (for me as humanitarian)
concepts through examples, encouraging students to learn some things beyond
main program of course independently. I like the fact that i learned how to
work with documentation to get information that I need.

During all the course I felt support of classmates and team of MOOC.

                    I have programmed for a living in the past (not in Python) but had grown rusty
after becoming a.... manager.  Although this course was pretty elementary from
a technical standpoint (as was intended), I found it valuable for getting some
actual hands-on experience, and I feel that it really helped me to take up my
next goal, which is to learn some of the data analytics frameworks such as
pandas and ipython notebooks, as a substitute for R.  Besides, it was just
fun.

One thing the course doesn't really address, but that might be a useful thing
to work in somehow, is file I/O - just reading and writing simple text files.
Maybe a chapter on saving/serializing the state of a game that can then be
reloaded and restarted later.  Not sure how that would work in the
CodeSkulptor environment though.

                    It's been brilliant.  It was tough but doable and there is as much help as you
need.  You do need to invest the time (around 10 hours a week) but it has been
great fun with lots of laughs and I have learnt loads.  Highly recommended.

                    I expected that by the end of the course, I would know how to use python to
its powers. And the course served the purpose. I like their slow pace and
teaching from the basics style. There's nothing specific to be mentioned that
I didn't liked. I would want to add one or two more weeks which could be
optional and which takes more complex problems and mini projects. Rest the
course was really awesome!

  

Cheers.!

                    That was a very interesting course. I started from zero and learned a lot.  
English is not my native language, but apart from a few small translaton-
problems, it was easy to understand, what the teachers said. (the words, not
allways the meanings! ;) )  
The level of this course is high, but not to hard. They teach you all you need
to know to do the next assigment/game, but you have to figure it out by
yourself in detail.  
Learning by doing, try and error.... the best way to understand.  
We all learned that way, when we were babies and tried to walk and speak and
eat and so on..  
So BIG THANKS to all the teachers there. Well done!

                    After many years of hanging out in web server side (ASP/PHP/Javascript) I've
decided to return to the basics and learn Python.

I spent around 6-8 hours a week learning and doing mini projects and always

                    I did expect to learn how you can work with Python, like the syntax or some
possibilities how I can solve certain problems. All these things I have
learned now.

I really liked the style of teaching, it wasn't just teaching the content, it
was more showing which fantastic things you can create with these concepts and
models in a funny way.

The deadlines where a little bit confusing at the beginning.

                    Some of the tools include: video lectures, practice exercises, an extensive
student forum, mini-project assignments, and quizzes. Additionally,
codeskulptor.org was used to make writing code easier. The only critique is
that codeskulptor may not be as familiar to those with some python background
and could take some adjusting.  

I took this class hoping that I would gain a background into the general
principles of programming so that I could continue learning on my own. In the
meantime, I fell in love with Python and programming in general.

If you have any reason to explore programming or Python, this course is fun
and moves at a great pace. Give it a shot.

                    I expected to learn just the basics of python programming and boy was I wrong.
I learned event driven programming, I learned how to make games using
codeskulptors GUI and of course, I learned lots of python programming as well.

It was the only intro programming course that I took and not only thoroughly
enjoyed but was also addicted to. Each week you build games in mini-projects
and learn python while doing it. This hands on approach made this an extremely
enjoyable and interesting course.

for Python,but also for all OOPs. These mini-projects designed with careful
considerations and I enjoyed myself when implementing them.Finally. Prof.
Scott, I like your voice.

                    The course has been a pleasant experience. I knew Python already but the
course enhanced my knowledge on python. The exercises were fun.

The only thing that can be improved is to give less code in the template. This
will help people develop their skills.

                    I could tell that these guys put a lot of time and efforts into this course.
The programming platform, a.k.a. CodeSkulptor.org, is wonderful, except that I
had to bread the Chinese GFW and it was painful. All the basic elements of
Python, list, tuple, class, etc., are briefly and clearly introduced. Although
programming is not only about learning, but rather about tons of practising,
this course sets a very good starting point.

                    Learn how to use GUI using Python

I loved this class. It kept me hooked till the end. Feeling kinda sad, since
it it over

As I took part in the Student Video Tutorial, I realised my potential of how I
can explain things. Although, I got eliminated, I got to know how and where I
need to improve. So definitely, I would improve my tutorial skills.

                    great stuff!  highly recommended!  it was hard because i had no experience
with a scripting language going in, but I put in the time and effort and I
think i got a lot out of it.  I will definitely take the next course in the
series.

                    I expected to have an easy start to Python and gain some experience to be able
to move on.

The interesting part of the classes are the mini projects. They are covered in
most of the videos. Those projects are very rewarding.  The quiz of each weeks
help to understand python better. And the programming tips are very helpful.

There could be more challenge on mini projects. Instead of giving hints on
every single steps, some extra thoughts could be exposed without too many
details.

                    The content is great but the course grading system sucks. It uses crowd-
sourced grading where you have to evaluate if the anonymous submission
completed the point. It only focuses on results and completely ignores the
code. So you could be writing terrible code that works and not really learning
anything about how to get better. There should be some impetus on the graders
to actually look at the code and evaluate the style and efficiency.\

Overall, it's a good class but the lack of rigorous grading leaves something
to be desired.

                    I signed up for Interactive Programming in Python because of the positive
reviews I had read previous to the start of my session. I finished the class a
couple days ago and all I can say is: ""WOW! Take this class!""

  

At the beginning, the class requires no background knowledge.  You start in
baby steps and by the end of Week 7, you are running marathons, so to speak.
In other words, don't be scared to take the class because you think to
yourself ""Oh, I'm just not good with computers"". Trust me, the instructors and
the structure of the course allow for everyone to get involved. The games that
you create are really fun to both build and play. This conscious decision to
create games as programming assignments is really what allows so many students
to feel engaged. The next time this class is offered, don't miss out. You'll
love it.

  

Difficulty: Beginning-Intermediate

Hours/wk: First 2 weeks: 3hr/wk; Week3-7: 6-9hr/wk

The only thing I would potentially change is introducing objected oriented
programming a week earlier as to allow the class to touch on a few more OOP
idioms.

                    I expected to learn enough python to understand the basics of game development
- and this was delivered in a very fun and effective way. I liked that a
different, but fully functional game was produced with each module so you
could see a completed project each week. The step by step instructions on how
to build the solution was often very useful, but I found it was easy to rely
on this; and such a thing would not be available if I was building something
from scratch myself. So perhaps there should be three levels of instruction
with various levels of detail or guidance where students could first try the
limited instruction, but then have access to the others as needed. It was very
useful to grade other students work, so that you were able to see differences
in coding approaches and solutions to the same problem.

                    I wanted to try something different and get back to some level of programming
as I used to program in other languages. My epxectations have been met and I
learned techniques that can be used beyond just python.

I like to call format and the continuous quiz/project work which make sure you
keep up the practice and are challenge to learn. The videos were great and
made in good progression toward more complexity.

Not sure what can be improved but having a more advanced class would be great
for people that do want to take it to the next step.

was able to learn so much from this course and to have a lot of dun in the

challenging yet attainable if you spend enough time to understand the material
and to do the assignment 10-15 hours a week. I recommend this course 100%

                    I wanted to learn get a better understanding of what object oriented
programming is and learn how to create programs in Python.

I liked the lectures on video because I could easily replay the parts that I
had trouble understanding.  I liked having quizes approximately twice per week
with a suggested 'soft' deadline.  This helped keep me on track.  I liked
having the the Practice Exercises which helped me better understand the topics
for that week before working on the mini-projects.  Having templates to start
out with for the mini projects worked great.  I especially liked the
development instructions for each mini-project because it helped me to
understand how starting out writing smaller pieces of the code first, testing
it, then adding to it, and testing that, etc.  The CodeSkulptor tool is
fantastic!!  it definitely helped in the learning process.  It made it easy to
start out programming without worrying about installing and setting up Python
on my computer.  

Improvements:  I am very happy with this class, Introduction to Interactive
Programming in Python.  I don't have any suggestions for improvement.  It has
been a positive experience that I highly recommend to others who want to learn
about Python.

                    An excellent short course on programming in Python with great instructors.
Works on multiple levels as an intro to any and all of programming,
interactive programming and the Python language. Huge class size, but all the
other students I dealt with were very friendly. Programming frameworks for
every assignment were given, so nothing was from scratch, and enough hints and
directions were provided from the course and forums to enable completing the
program each week. Sept-Nov course timing was not so good for a student in the
Southern Hemisphere since the course interposed on final exams and
assignments, but the time requirements were not so demanding as to dis-allow
some time-juggling. Highly recommended.

                    I learn more than I expected and I do not see anything that needs improvement.
Maybe more time for the bigger projects at the end but then again I dont want
the class to become too long.

Let me mention one thing - none of my mini-projects works without bugs. But
that has a good side: now I can work to improve it and learn to do it better
the first time. And this is much more than what I expected. I had fun.

Thank you!

                    Course was well paced and I learned what I needed in order to code the
projects that I want to do.

I liked that the course built up to a specific project and that throughout the
course we made games.  Also, I found the peer-review to be very helpful in
learning how other people solved the same task as I had.

For improvement, I would like if there was a course that followed this one, so
that my learning could continue without interruption.

                    Frankly I took it for fun, and it was first exposure to Python, and initially
I did not think of doing any of the projects. However, after lessening to the
first two weeks of videos I got excited and motivated and started doing the
quizzes and projects.

Great Job!   Joe w., Scott R., John G., Stephen W., and Rice Univ.    I hope
to see advanced Python topics taught in near future.

                    I'll begin be reiterating what a fantastic course this was! I think this
course can meet the needs of many levels of student, but I would highly
recommend for beginner students because the quality of instruction in this
course is excellent and not always found in other courses.

I expected to learn some more Python language. The exposure to GUI game
programming was more of a curiosity then necessity for my career needs. I
course was successful in meeting both my objectives.

Things I really appreciated about some of the instructors and feel should not
go unnoted: Joe Warren brought a real personal touch to the course which is
particularly important in a MOOC; his humor and passion for the course was
inspiring!  Scott Rixner has an wonderful ability to convey technical material
in an easily understandable manner; he is the type of instructor you want
teaching all my courses.

Suggestion: adding another 1-2 weeks of application of the ""beyond
CodeSkulptor"" concept. For example, taking a project and modifying/enhancing
it further using one of the eternal GUI python libraries outside of CS tool.
Understandably this can be a self motivated exercise, however it might
facilitate the ""transition"" if Joe and Scott provided a few video insightful
lectures and mini-project as illustration to students.

                    I expected to learn the basics of Python structures and get an introduction to
Object-oriented Programming -- exactly what they taught.  To me one
improvement would be to take a little longer on the first project in which
object-oriented programming is used.  For those of us with some previous
programming experience from back in the dark ages, OOP is quite a shift, and
learning how to do what you could so easily do using non-OOP methods takes a
bit of time.

                    I wanted to learn python, and I learned a lot.  I liked everything about the
course.  Viz, specially, helped me understand a lot about the process and how
it works.  There are certain things, GUI in that Viz does not work well with.
If there were a thing I would like to improve on would be on that--expanding
Viz.  Also, I love the programming tips section--very awesome.

                    I actually went into this class with no expectations.  I thought it sounded
interesting and I was right.  It turned out to be very interesting, fun and
challenging.

I liked using the things I learned each week to build some sort of game.  It
helps keep thing interesting and light hearted.

One thing I had a hard time with was the schedule.  The first few weeks were
not too bad, but the last 4-5 weeks were tough getting things done on time.
Not that they were that hard, just tough to keep on schedule.  Not much time
for ""exploring"" and practice.  I guess I would stretch it out for a few more
weeks and allow for more practice (like the week on classes).

                    I expected to learn the VERY basics of programming with python, but I learned
SOO MUCH MORE!! I was so awesome and I 100% recommend it to everyone that
likes programming, or anyone that likes a challenge!! I personally was not
introduced to programming before this class (I didn't like it, or not-like
it), but now i totally LOVE it!! The class was very well organized and
instructed. I attempted to look for additional classes to enroll in through
Coursera since I liked this one so much, and could not find anything that
compared even REMOTELY to this class!! It was seriously just soo well done. I
am very happy with the course and my time here. It was a little bit
challenging, but I like challenges and am glad I had the opportunity to
experience this!

                    I loved this class. It was very effective and taught me a great deal. I thing
that I would have liked is to see the instructor solutions to the mini-
projects after the deadline to submit had expired. This would allow us to
compare our solutions to the instructor's.

  

Looking forward to taking another class with this team.

  

Thank you very very much!!!!

                    I wanted to learn the basics to Python. A language I have read about, whose
popularity has grown.

The lecturers were excellent. Great teachers. Lovely humour that helped make
the classes enjoyable. The fact that games were the part of the homeworkd
makes it more fun to work on.

The CodeSkulptor was an excellent tool.  I think it needs to be improved with
respect to the Viz mode (debugging) when graphics are used. Not very easy to
debug mouse clicks, button presses, etc.

                    I came into this course expecting an introduction to the python language, and
the course exceeded my expectations. I had not expected to be able to complete
a game by the time I was done (albeit a simple one), and I didn't expect so
many aspects of programming to be not only covered but covered extremely well.
The concepts were well covered, and the instructors kept it interesting
throughout.

I found the pacing of the course to be perfect (provided you keep up week to
week, I can see people getting a little overwhelmed if they were to fall
behind at any stage). The amount of work to complete each week was challenging
(keeping in mind I work full time) but always achievable. Add to that the
content would consistently expand on concepts taught in previous weeks as well
as covering new ground, which served to solidify my understanding of thee
concepts whilst still making progress.

good working knowledge of Python- however the fact that the course uses its

                    I wanted to learn more about programming languages in general and Python in
particular. Particularly GUI applications and games.  
  
In my opinion the course is wonderful, full of challenges but with a lot of
support from the teachers, the TA's and other students. The video lectures are
short and to the point. The quizzes, there are a couple of them every week,
are also short and not very difficult.  The weekly Mini projects are more
demanding but a fantastic learning experience.  
  
One of the things I liked best was the incredible documentation available.
When you don't have much experience programming it's really helpful to be able
to look up your doubts and find clear explanations and plenty of examples.
Another great thing about the course was the Forums, a real lifesaver, when
you're struggling you can always find a lot of help there.  
  
Highly recommended.

modules like the GUI modules.  This course was perfect for that.  I have
programming experience for engineering but never programmed a GUI before.
Math and logic were easy for me but the application of Python's unique class
features, function structure and workflow were very helpful.  I think I'll be
able to work comfortably with Python now.  I'm ready to learn more.

                    I hoped to learn python sufficiently well to write programs having several
aspects, which this course provided.

I liked everything that was included. However I would have liked to have seen
a little video lecture time spent some of the uncovered functionality
described in the docs e.g. the set methods,  

I missed taking one quiz simply because I forgot - I would have liked to had
some tickler to remind me - like an email 6 hours before the deadline.

Overall I really enjoyed it :-)

                        I wanted to learn how to make games right from the start. Let me just say that i found the perfect course, the first week's project was already a game, it may be a simple one but still it had engaging elements. As the weeks passed i found myself learning new skils, object oriented programing being the one that i loved the most.

    The one thing that sometimes was a bit annoying were the quizes, i was able to compleet them all with ful score, but i had to repeet them at least once because of some little detail that i missed, but i can't qualify this as a negative point because i learned a lot with the errors i made.

learn through interactive games

effective. The core concepts are translatable to any programming project. It
is the engaging and lightweight nature of the material and its delivery that
made this class very enjoyable.

\- I would improve peer to peer interactions. The forum has  a lot of
activity. What seems to be needed is more ways to connect and explore topics
between peers. The idea of video contests where anyone taking the course can
explain material is fantastic. More ideas like this would benefit the
experience of everyone taking the course and ultimately make education more

                    Initially I thought we'd learn real interactive programming using GUI in
python so at first I was a bit disappointed. Later I realized that it is the
techniques that are introduced and not concrete libraries which is even more
valuable. That's because a solid foundation is more important because it can
be then applied to many different concrete tools.

I'd recommend putting more advanced courses in the subject and maybe at that
point actually use a specific library?

                    I expected to learn some introductory concepts in Python. I really feel like I
now have a good handle on Python and Object Oriented Programming now. I liked
the teachers, the mini-assignments (making mini-games) and the multiple ways
to receive help when stuck on assignments. I can't really think of anything I
disliked or would improve upon. I highly recommend this course!

                    A couple of years ago I had read a bit about programming with Python and
wanted to refresh my knowledge and also expand it a bit further. Could not
find a better place than this course for this. Well balanced course, also
quite fun and challenging near the end.

                    The course is thought to be taken by people that have no experience or
background in programming. Taking this in account, I believe the teaching
methodology in place was just perfect. Progressively the student learns all
he/she needs to succeed at the class. Also, the way the teachers present the
instructions for the assignments are great to understand exactly what you have
to do.

                    I expected to learn how to program with graphics and Python. And I DID!!! I
had never done anything like this and was nervous but with the brilliant way
they taught I got every single assignment working.

The instructors were funny - but really really good. They managed to teach in
such a way that when it came to doing the assignments - I could manage to do
them.

                    I expected to learn more about Python programming at a faster pace. I had
taken a couple classes before this one. The first was very algorithm focused
and frankly very challenging with a three hour final exam that I didn't have
time to complete. Too abstract. The second was an extremely gentle
introduction to everything from data-structures to algorithms to web scraping,
but was a bit too slow. Too simplistic. So I still needed something else...

This class delivered. It was faster paced and didn't go into excruciating
detail about every command keyword and the history of computing, etc. Instead
it more or less gave me the impression that I was taking a real class online
for a real grade taught at the pace of a true course. It was truly hard at
times but I was able to pull through and the struggle made me a better
programmer and problem solver, I feel. As for dislikes, I'm not sure. The
forums crowd seemed lively, and got much livelier and more diverse when we got
to graphical game making, but at first they seemed a little daunting because
the only prolific posters were complete beginners who needed help from the
established crowd of professional programmers /those who knew Python already
but wanted to learn event driven programming.

As for improvements, I'm not sure. Codeskulptor is amazing and seems very
smart. Hey - I can just write some python in my browser and throw up a GUI for
it anywhere without having to install python and cloud save the files for
later use. Thank you for that!

But the downside is I now have to learn to use all the third party libraries.
It would be nice if someone could show us how to create a frame or something
extremely basic using his package of choice (like Pygame or Tkinter). That
would make the lighbulb go off for sure.

                    I expect to learn a little bit of python and in the end I think I'm have
enough skills to move on to build complex python programs in different
environments, not related to gaming programming.

I liked the way the course is structured, teaching the students from simple
things to more advanced features, a thing that also applied to the approach to
the mini-projects.

I only would improve the grade of involvement of John and Stephen, it was
great to see Joe and Scott playing different games, but I think that playing
also with John and Stephen would have made the course even more fun!

                    Learned beyond the basics.  Demystified classes, much better understanding of
lists, dictionaries, sets, loops and iterations.  Manipulations, when and why
you need to create a new list while iterating through them.  Mutable vs.
immutable.  Great to have a goal to work towards rather than having snippets
of code to learn from.  Forum support was unbelievably great and fast.  Lots
of knowledgeable people helping you out there.

Highly recommend this course and looking forward to the next one on the next
level.  Very impressed with the games that are in the ""Hall of Fame"" submitted
from the students in the class.

                    The instructors humor and teaching styles led to one of the most approachable
introductions to programming I've found. The course progressed at a swift, but
manageable pace that kept my interest up.

I wish they had gone a little more in-depth about next steps to take after the
course, but there a plenty of resources out there that I can dig into with the
background knowledge I've gained in this course.

                    I wanted a thorough grounding in Python, and I got that - covering concepts
I'd seen reference to but not investigated myself

I picked up things I wasn't expecting - the event-driven and object-oriented
programming techniques, and working in a GUI environment. The CodeSkulptor
environment used for the course is an excellent teaching tool/resource. So
well done Rice and Scott.

I enjoyed the weekly quizzes and assignments. The quizzes were multi-choice,
but that belies hidden depth - some of the questions required you to write
programs to solve the problem. That meant you had tested yourself thoroughly
on the week's material before tacking the project.

The projects were great - we produced surprisingly sophisticated programs for
a course suitable for beginners to programming.

I can't think of anything obvious that needs improving. Perhaps just add a
follow on course for improving Python programmers, with new challenges?! But
really we're ready to be released into the wild and get on with it now.

                    The course was very heavy on Simple GUI module. That is great. However, it
would have been nice to know more about other python features. Something as
simple as try catch.. raising errors, file handling, regular expressions. If
you can improve on that, it would be great.

                    I didn't think a course like this existed, so I was really excited to learn
how the nuts and bolts of this interactive python stuff actually work. I am
very impressed and I took away a lot from this course. I don't there is much
to improve on because I learned a lot of math that I saw no relevance for
until I got to apply it (15+ years later), now I'm interested in math again,
that-is the geometry/trigonometry/calculus -- and I am terrible at math too!

  

Wonderful course, and feels very satisfying to complete it knowing I filled in
a lot of gaps to use in the future.

                    I learned Python, as expected.  I know some other programming languages, and I
would have liked some more background on ""why Python"" and what the strengths
and weaknesses of the language are.

Because I enjoy games (writing and playing), the projects were terrific.

To improve: more about good programming style.  Python allows you to write
code ""all over the place"".

                    While I was a little skeptical of peer evaluation, I found that every one was
quite supportive and encouraging. Rubric for the space ship project was
confusing

a little bit and forums were helpful to see that others were having similar
problems. I did not realize there were video competitions  since I never went
to

the home page!  It would nice to have the instructors talk about all th eother
things that happen in the forums (they did, and may be I mised them?)

                    AMAZING!!

Excellent course, professional, and enjoyable lecturers, great content and a
lot of material, exercises and examples to work on.

For me, individual completely out of CS, taking this course was a somewhat a
challenge but with excellent lectures and course materials forcing one to
think about what one's actually learning, I've made whole way through,
Completing this course  gave me a lot of satisfaction and confidence that I
want to follow this path in a future with courses  form Rice and this team in
particular.

If you're considering starting your adventure with programming or Computer
Science in general, I strongly recommend taking this course - it starts in
moderate pace but gets a lot of momentum rather quickly so... fasten your seat
belts and take marvelous and delightful intellectual ride in to the world of
programming.

                    I hoped to learn more about the proper use of classes in programming so I was
pleased to see them being introduced.  I was nervous about the use of global
variables but, after watching one of the closing videos, understand better why
they were being used.  My immediate interest in taking this course was a card
game program I was working on.  After completing it I can see many ways to
improve what I have and make it more complete.  Improvements?  I'd like to see
more advanced topics, such as the ones discussed in the ""Beyond Code Skulptor""
video but the material for this course, I think, was right where it needed to
be.  Might there, perhaps, be a future course? . . . Please?

thought I would. The lectures were well thought out and presented. Loved

best course I've ever taken, including graduate level courses at university.

                    The class is effective, well-orchestrated, and supported by
instructors/community TAs who obviously are quite generous with their time and
talents.  The mini-projects are carefully scaffolded so that the amount of
student work needed to reach successful functioning is minimized, but
appropriate to the weekly topics.  In the video lectures, the instructors
demonstrate a good sense of humor.  Learner community support was very good; I
saw very few posts/replies that were contentious.

I took it to learn Python, having used a number of other languages and
environments for programming.  For me, the course was a winner.

                    Since I was more or less expirirenced in the field student, I would make it
more intensive, and even maybe short. One thing I really dislike is that
during peer-asessments at the end of the course I've noticed a lot of code
copy-pasted from the web (from the students who took the Course previously).
For example at last peer-asessment (8-th project, asteroids game), 4 of 5
projects were copy-pasted.

                    My drive to take this course was to play with the Raspberry pi. Gameduino 2 is
a touchscreen that works with raspberry pi that can be used for developing
games. It is simpler to use python for writing a complex  program as opposed
to embedded programming using arduino. After this coursework, I am pretty
confident that I can start working for the cause using python programming. I
like the way the professors taught the course in a short amount of time. I
have no comments for improvement.

                    I learned a ton completing RiceRocks, and it's given me both the knowledge and
the confidence to tackle larger Python projects on my own. Of course, I plan
to take the followup courses if/when they are offered next year.

The course materials were outstanding, and the instructors did a terrific job
of tying together the lectures, practice exercises, and assignments - it was a
very integrated whole - a much better job than other programming classes I
took as an undergrad, where theory (lecture) and practice (homework) could be
quite far apart. You can tell how much thought and work went into putting
together this course.

For Python and and other programming topic, there is so much information out
there, it's hard to make sense of it all or know where to begin. The greatest
value of this class was the structure it provided to get through a large
amount of learning at in an organized, consistent way. I'm very grateful.

course was known to be hard, so it should be taken seriously. It's true: it
has to be taken seriously, but it's very useful, too... and very entertaining!
There were moments when I surprised myself waiting for the next lesson the
same way I wait for the new episode of my favourite TV show! Great work: I'll
wait for the sequel ;) (Sorry about my english: I'm italian).

                    I guess I expected to learn interactive GUI programming using python.

didn't really like that there was no aspect of actually using 'actual' python.
Although it would get too complicated I think for true newbies to programming.
It would be helpful for instance to have a website on the side that explained
how to get started using python. How to install SimpleGuiTK and view
CodeSkulptor code actually working.

Maybe even some samples using Tkinter that did the same thing as the course
assignments.

But IIPP is still a really good course without any changes.

                    I expected to learn about writing programs in Python. However this course
steered away from abstract uses of features of the Python programming
language, but instead quickly moved into making working games - simple ones to
start with - which were gradually built upon. Concepts were introduced in the
context of completing that week's assignment, rather than just something to
learn, which meant we quickly reached a position of making graphical games
which worked, and could be customised to some extent. After 8 weeks, the final
game is quite something - although some of the detail was provided to enable
the student to concentrate on the concepts to be learned without getting
bogged down in some implementation details.  

I liked the quality of the videos which - if you watched carefully and took
your own notes, provided nearly all the information needed to complete the
quizzes and assignment for that week. I liked the element of humour in the
rivalry between Joe and Scott, which showed how the assignment should work but
in a fun way. I liked the way that John showed us novices how to debug our
code when simple print statements were not sufficient to figure out what is
going on - especially the need to look for unexpected mutation (when two
variables become the same entity).

What did I dislike? Nothing. Improvements? Hard to see anything obvious. The
quality of the course materials were of such a high standard, but put together
in a simple and easy to understand way, that if you did the work then you got
the outcome, maybe with a little help from your peers or the code clinic along
the way. I think the course walked the tightrope of meeting the needs of a
vast range of abilities (and first languages) with finesse and struck the
bullseye.

                    I was hoping to learn how to code well in Python because I'm teaching a Python
class at our homeschool co-op to a small group of 14 year old boys, including
my son.  This class definitely helped achieve that goal, and I got to send
them a link to my final version of Rice Rocks last night which I know they're
going to love.  I was also hoping to learn about event driven programming and
classes and objects, since I studied neither in college, nor have I used
either in any of my jobs as a programmer.  This class definitely accomplished
that and I am very appreciative.  I think you all are excellent instructors.
You taught the material very well.  I also really appreciated the templates
and the level of care and detail in making sure we had the information we
needed to be successful and finish the assignments.  I trusted that you
wouldn't leave us hanging and that you would give us the information we needed
to be able to write the code.  I loved that we just had to fill in the pieces
so we could create all the awesome games you had for the miniprojects.  It was
very motivational.  I had a lot of fun in this class, and although I'll be
glad to have the extra time now that the class is over, I'm definitely sad to
see it end.  Thank you Joe and Scott for all the time and effort you obviously
put into the class to make it such a great success and thank you John for all
your programming tips.  I loved watching those.

                    I loved everything (and that's a lot), especially how challenging, yet not
impossible mini-projects were...  except maybe for some questions in quizzes.
Sometimes there were a bit vague (though in general quizzes were great too!).
I highly recommend this course to everyone!! But I also recommend doing a
self-pased Python course on CodeCademy before this one, as a really basic and
slow intro to Python.

                    Very well covered, extremely well covered!

I just wished Scott and Joe would have covered a bit more Object Oriented
Programming, I feel OO concepts were barely scratched and that they could have
spend more time with Inheritance in py (perhaps multiple inheritance) and
polymorphic behaviours in Python.

However I understand this is an introductory course targeted to perhaps less
experienced programmers, therefore for this reason I believe this is an
extremely helpful course and one everyone developer thinking to gain some
experience in python should perhaps take.

                    I was hoping to learn the rudiments of OOP and I did! I'm really happy about
that. I had already tried a bit of pygame. Codeskulptor provides a nice simple
interface for the same sort of thing.

I liked the debugging help that Codeskulptor offers (Viz mode) but the windows
and lines get too busy as you add functions.

I also liked the mini-project series. The projects form a nice progression and
build your knowledge. I also liked the forums and I especially liked the code
clinic where you could get hints from the staff when you got stuck.

Improvements: One minor one; Codeskulptor needs a print button (print with
line numbers). It would also be helpful to add a video on flowcharting along
with some advice on keeping our approaches to coding organized. Maybe, along
with the flowcharting, a video on program design (especially OOP based
programs) would help.

                    I have started learning Python like half of the year ago, and while looking
for some good material that would help me in learning Python, I found this
course. Though there was no beginning date, I felt pretty excited about the
idea of studying in this class. So I clicked, that ""follow"" button, and went
on searching for Python stuff.  
  
I got an e-mail back in September, notifying that the course is about to
start. By that time I've already gained a little experience in Python, and I
got some concerns about this class, due to lack of time and some minor
problems, but I decided like, lets give it a crack.  
  
There was not a single minute that I would regret about that decision. It was
a terrific experience. It felt like I'm one of many of those who are keen on
getting the joy of programming. It was really fun to learn new things and to
assess my classmates.  
  
Special thanks to the teachers of this class. They've done an enormous amount
of work that I think all of the students highly appreciate. All of them are
kind and stimulating, it's been a pleasure to view all the lectures they made.  
  
To sum this up, no matter whether you are new to programming or you had some
experience already, this is a great way to learn new things, especially if you
are eager to start programming in Python. It will definitely help you in
gaining some Python (and programming in general) skills.

                    A range of coding skills including animation, data handling and keyboard
events.

Codeskulptor, the browser based editor and execution environment, is pretty
good.

Disliked one particular aspect of the quizzes. ( questions were fine ). The
quiz would re-arrange or change some of the questions between attempts meaning
that the student had to re-take most of the quiz each time.

I would very much like to practice more on my logic and problem and solution
definitions. I now know how to program but (sometimes) my logic is falling
short. I am hoping that the upcoming courses of the specialization track
'Fundamentals of computing' and additional practice will address this.

                    I expected to learn enough about python that I could continue on by myself
comfortably.

I liked the mini projects. Games was a good choice even though I rarely play
them.

I know deadlines are necessary, but they can be inconvenient.

I wanted to learn something about Python. I had no definite purpose for it in
mind. Sometimes part of the difficulty is coming up with a project to apply
the new skill. I liked how some idea was given how to move on to regular
Python. I think it might be good to give suggestions of ideas for more
projects.

I like how we could use codeskulptor to do the mini-projects so that way it
was easy to access it from anywhere. I also like how they used several ways to
provide help when people got stuck doing the mini-project.

This was by far the best learning experience that I had.

                    The video's and assignments are of high quality and usually useful and
pleasant to watch. The mini projects - remaking existing games - are nice,
although perhaps hold your hand a bit too much. They rarely ask you to make
any real design decisions on the structure of your code, which is mostly
given.  

Codeskulptor, the environment used, does what it says on the can: a fully
functional and easy to use web environment. I prefer a more fully featured IDE
(I used Spyder a bit), f.e. with autocomplete based on method signatures, but
for the goal of the course that's really not needed and might even be a bad
thing if it keeps people from looking up more information in the
documentation.

Had a great time making those fun games! And nice humor on the teaching team.

I would (sure others would too) really like a follow-up course!

                    The course is interesting -it is primarily about event driven programming
using python. I took this course expecting it would be handy at work (where I
see python being used for debugging and automating) -unfortunately despite the
excellent teaching and challenging assignments, I felt the course was more
about using python to build games.

It's a very basic course for programmers with some experience.  Although, I
wouldn't recommend this course for people who are completely new to
programming. If you are new to programming learn the basics first, then take
this course and you'll learn a lot!

Overall it's a great course I strongly recommend ir.

                    It was great fun but no walk in the park. Expect to put in many hours outside
of the lectures.  

Python has bifurcated into Python 2.X and Python 3.X. And as I discovered
there are some differences.  

2.X - which is what is used in this course - is still being developed because
many existing programs were written in it and there are a lot of existing
libraries

works beautifully, lectures are clear and interesting and the quizzes are spot
on. The lecturers are engaging and the assignments are the best part - writing
a series of short games, each increasing in complexity just enough to test new
concepts. Great course - looking forward to the next Python course done by the

                    As a stay-at-home parent (for 12 years now) who had worked for 10 years as a
software engineer, I found this course perfect for me. While I already knew
the design piece, python was a completely new subject for me, and I had not
done much event-driven programming as is used in the games in this course. The
provided online Python interpreter made for an easy entry point and the
assignments were very well broken down so someone new to programming could
just follow the steps. The quizzes were harder than in other courses I've
taken - these instructors want you to get comfortable experimenting in code to
answer questions, rather than memorize how every command works. Plan for more
time than you think it will take to do the quizzes. There are also practice
exercises offered. If you haven't programmed before, looking at these will be
helpful, but again - they take time. The mini-projects (due weekly) are fun to
build. You are given a template from which to start and step-by-step
instructions on which parts to implement and test before moving to the next
step. The games increase in complexity and week 8's game builds on week 7's.
In the beginning, the games are simple text. In the end, you are building
blackjack and asteroids. The forums (for support) are great too. There are
always people on - other students, TA's, even the instructors themselves are
an active presence here, and the forums are divided out well enough that it's
easy to find what you're looking for. The instructors take what is typically a
dry subject and make it fun with a playful teaching style and approach to
coding. Fantastic course - I highly recommend it. I learned lots and had a
blast and now my 9yo son wants to take it!

                    Prior experience with programming: some. I've written simple procedural tools
at work for mathematical conversion, etc. On the plus side, the projects
almost always were some form of computer game. For the 70% of people who play
computer games, this made it a very accessible course. For the 30% of us that
have never enjoyed computer games, it was actually a pretty big setback. The
big negative is this: ALL the information content is in the videos. There are,
in theory, transcripts from the videos, but it's clear they were created by an
audio speech-to-text translation program that did a horrible job. You end up
with NO WAY to reference items you may or may not have learned. This course
BADLY needs a textbook or summary of the information in the videos. The
provided ""Concepts and Examples"" section is pretty good, but, not organized
into sensible elements and not useful as a reference. In the first half of the
course, the videos are pretty straightforward, information is provided -
although without much explanation that frames it. ""Do this"" rather than ""when
you do this, you are implementing what is known as...."" The instructors get
punch-drunk after the first half, and the percentage of the video that
contains mostly self-serving jokes begins to rise, until the very last video
""summary"", which is five minutes basically, of two profs saying ""this was a
lot of work for us to do, aren't we great!"" If you have no programming
experience, figure 30-35 hours a week. If you have a LOT of programming
experience, figure 15-20 hours (a bunch of us at work took the course
together, and the most seasoned programmers in our midst still say it took a
lot of time). If you have the time, it's a good class. I stashed all the
videos for later review, as well as quizzes and homeworks, and I'll finish it
as I have the time. And I will write my own reference book from the videos.

is one of the most interesting courses i've taken and really pleasant to
attend. The course is well-organised,the prodessors are nice,the information

Most of all,the miniprojects were extremely explanatory and self-guiding. I'd
suggest this course to anyone aspiring to program in python and build his own
games.

                    Python was not my first programming language. I had completed a course online
in Java but I do not have a CS degree so my intent is to gain a better
conceptual understanding of programming and best practices. So far, this was
my favorite intro to programming class. The lectures are about the right
length, informative, engaging. The assignments are fun to complete. For
experienced programmers interested in learning python, the content might be
too slow or too much review. I think this class is ideal for beginning

                    Great course. Good blend of theory and practice. The Codeskulptor environment
allowed us to get moving quickly without dealing with install hassles, and
since we were all using the same tools, peer review was easy. I programmed for
years, but had not coded anything for a decade. I was able to get going again
quickly, thanks to the curriculum design, quiz and project design, and access
to the easy to use coding environment. I have not taken any coding MOOCs
before, but have taken several non-programming MOOCs. This is one of the best
examples I have experienced of the MOOC medium to-date. The
instructors/creators did a great job in making this course both fun and

Python. I took the codecademy self paced course to give myself a base, and

course were very new for me. I managed to complete all projects and the last
one after 7 weeks (of over 10 hrs/ week of work with teers and moments of
despair) seemed even surprisingly easy compared to the projects I had to do in
the middle of the course. Completing these projects though would not be
possible without all the materials and guidance that have been provided by
organizators, forum discussions, step by step descriptions for projects, great
teachers, TAs, tutorials and support from other students. The load of work
that these people have done is amazing. I absolutely recommend and say thanks
to all who worked on this!

interactive event programming! If you are a begginer in python, enroll.

this course with a feeling of accomplishment. The teachers are awesome, every
week they teach you what you need to know to complete your assignment. If you
follow the progression listening to the videos, doing the quizzes and doing
mini projects, you will be able to meet the challenge of completing the
project every week. There is help out there on discussion forums too. Over all
I am happy that I learned so much and able to move forward from here.

really quite outdated (FORTRAN, Pascal, etc.). I had also previously taken
Coursera courses but generally related to music rather than programming (one
was actually both). This course was absolutely superb! The topics are well-
presented, everything we needed to do the work was carefully explained, and
the descriptions of the mini-projects outlined very precisely what steps we
needed to do to successfully write them. I really don't there was ANYTHING

                    As a complete newbie (no prior programming experience, my last math class was
high school algebra), it was very challenging, but ultimately so satisfying to
""get"" the code and see it magically transformed into fun games like Pong,
Blackjack, and Asteroids. (I would highly recommend preparing prior to the
start of class with a self-paced Python learning site such as codecademy.com).
The professors taught with a sense of humor and understanding for all levels
of students. It was wonderful to be a part of a global community of students
who helped each other through discussion forums and posted their own
wonderfully inspired videos to explain concepts. Knowing tens of thousands of
classmates would be asking for individual help through the email Code Clinic,
I was amazed and astonished how quickly the dedicated TA's would get back to
me with help and encouragement. I've taken 2 other Coursera classes and this
one had the best professors/videos, specialized application (CodeSkulptor/Viz
Mode), projects, and camaraderie. In today's world everyone should learn how
to code.

                    I started the course without any background on Python. After 8 weeks, however,
I was able to program some cool games. Instructors are very passionate about
what they are doing and have put so much effort in making the class
interesting. The whole course is well organized with video lectures, quizzes,
practice exercises, and weekly projects where you really get the chance to put
in practice what you learned. The discussion forum is very active and support
from peers is encouraging. The central piece of the entire course is
CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org), which allows to run Python code directly
from the web in a very convenient way. A simple web address is the only thing
your friends and family will need to run your cool games. Instructors and TAs
have put a lot of effort and time to bring up this course to the level of
quality it is today, and besides the interesting topics being discussed, the
instructors can make some funny jokes too. My time was well spent in
completing the course. Highly recommended for those looking to start with

                    I've been in the IT/R&D; world 30 years. I was once on the faculty at CUNY,
Dept. of Computer Science and have years of teaching experience. This class
was very well conceived and executed, particularly in light of the
difficulties inherent to online training where there are thousands of students
enrolled. Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, John Greiner, and Steven Wong have done a
fine job and I am confident that with time this class stands only to improve.
They have gone the extra mile to make Python coding accessible to those with
zero experience and I daresay that this must have made a huge difference to
many of the students. As training paradigms expand outward from the classroom
and into people's homes and offices, the work of people like Scott and Joe
becomes increasingly significant in its impact on the lives of growing numbers
of students who would not have been able to undertake such learning otherwise.
It is my hope that their colleagues, including administrators, will take heed
of the words of a man who has been in the businesses of both professional
development, R&D;, and classroom teaching and examine what is happening at
Rice with an open mind and an eye to the future. I can see only good coming of
this.

                    I used to program in 'C' for my job, but have not done any hardcore
programming in about a decade. This course is the best I have run across. The
teachers are entertaining and at the same time providing a lot of great
information. This course really worked well for me (programming experience)
and my daughter (10 y.o., with no programming experience). She did not make it
all the way through the course but was able to keep up while she had time to
invest in it. She liked the programming exercises as well as the lectures.
Highly recommend this course, it has reminded me what I liked about
programming.

                    As a 42 year old IT professional, I had really no experience in programming
(at least not in the last 20 years) of any kind. My last programming language
was in college (Pascal) with a now-dead language. I stumbled across this
course while looking to increase my skill set in script writing and after
completing a self-paced course on codeacademy.com. This course met and
exceeded all of my expectations. The first few weeks were simple programming.
The next few got a little tougher and the last three weeks in particular were
very tough. However, with that difficulty came a great sense of accomplishment
when I completed the mini-projects. The forums were absolutely invaluable to
completing the projects and everyone in there was incredibly supportive.

                    I took this course with the Signature Track option. The professors taught the
course well. Each week, for nine weeks, the course consisted of three parts:
watching a series of lectures, taking two quizzes, and completing a mini-
project (coding increasingly more complex games). The lectures were well-
organized, the quizzes relevant, and the mini-projects challenging but not too
daunting. Moreover, code templates for each project helped me a lot in
successfully completing it. The class was fun. It made learning Python and
interactive programming enjoyable. I believe I learned enough about object-
oriented programming and event-driven programming to apply that knowledge to
other languages and future projects. I am not a professional programmer,
although I do program in my profession (engineering). The class helped me to
understand Python in particular, and modern programming in general. I plan to
take the rest of the Signature Track courses in the Fundamentals of Computing
track. I think the course costs are reasonable and the teaching quality well
worth the money.

done a lot of self-taught programming), LOVED this course. He found it
challenging but doable, until about half-way through when it required calculus
to complete the problem sets. So, a warning is that you do need to know
calculus to complete the course.

                    Great weekly videos, quizzes, and mini-projects. The mini-projects are games
which make the learning engaging. The final project was a version of
Asteroids. I had one year of Python before taking this course, but I am sure a
beginner would find everything they need to succeed. Certainly worth your

and Joe! That has been most fantastic learning experience in my lifetime. I
have tried to learn Python for few years now, and never could get any source
that would suit me, and always got discouraged by something in the given
source (online blogs, python documentation, books), but your course got me
there! I finally not only understand python, but I have understood what object
oriented programing is all about (never could get a gasp of that either from
above sources). I am coming back for a paid certificate in next semester, just
so you guys get these pennies you deserve from me! :)

                    I came into this class with no experience at programming of any kind. I was
also pretty bad at math. I really want to change careers to one in software
development, but I was not sure if that was something I could do. I have taken
other MOOCs before, on Coursera and other sites. This was by far the best MOOC
i have ever taken. The course is well organized and well designed for
beginners like me. The video lectures were very informative and entertaining.
The quizzes were challenging, the mini-projects were challenging and sometimes
very challenging. Thanks to the lectures, very active forum, supportive peers,
and the rest of the course content, I was able to accomplish the projects and
get perfect scores. I actually made programs. I felt such a great sense of
accomplishment from creating a game from beginning to end. This course is
wonderful. I feel confident that I can make the transition into programming
one day. I am continuing on through the other sections of this course and
eventually the capstone project. I am enrolled in the signature track. I
HIGHLY recommend this course. The instructors are great and so is the content.

Though I had sufficient time to invest to ensure a good outcome for myself I
am aware that others have struggled to find enough free time to make the class
effective. My initial intent was to only spend a few hours a week on the class
and repeat it later to fill in the gaps. But it was such an enjoyable

                    In short: I had the best online learning experience in this course. I highly
recommend it to EVERYONE and if you do decide to take it I will be rather
envious because I cannot go through that experience again. It wasn't my first
MOOC but will be the most remembered. I was new to Python, but have studied
other languages in uni. The course is very well balanced: It never felt easy
and/or boring (unlike some others) and challenged me right at that fine line
where the assessments were just hard enough to require plenty time thinking
and not seem easy at first but not so challenging to cause frustration. The
teachers seem to love what they do and it comes across in many ways that makes
the course and watching the lectures that much more enjoyable. I am a full-
time uni student as well and yet I ended up watching this course's lectures,
doing the quizzes and mini-projects before everything else. I've even
submitted my actual uni assignments (for which I paid) late because I got too
busy doing the mini-projects in this course (which didn't cost me a dime) that
weren't due until much later in the week. If you're reading this to help you
decide and because there's the slight chance you may take this course, JUST DO
IT!

                    Highly recommended course! It was quite challenging but provided tremendous
resources to support even novices. My background is in Educational Technology,
and I was very impressed with the design of the course. The weekly project
assignments were perfectly designed to teach that week's concepts, from the
start with ""Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock"" teaching the basic concepts of
logic, conditionals, and functions to the capstone ""Rice Rocks"" dealing with
classes, sprites, and sets. The short weekly lecture videos were entertaining
as well as informative. Each week had one or two quizzes that reinforced the
concepts and challenged your understanding. Short practice exercises (with
solutions provided in case you really got stumped) did a great job of
scaffolding the users progress. A major advantage provided by a popular MOOC
is the forum. There is a lot of support available here, from other students,
community TAs, and even the instructors. Beyond learning to write code in
Python, this course is an exceptional way to learn how to learn. You get
compelling challenges presented in a fun and engaging way, feedback through
both peer assessments and forums, and lots of resources to help you succeed.
This course offers the excellent benefits of learning to code: developing your
ability to think logically, systematically, and creatively. It would be a
shame if the only people who take Intro to Interactive Programming with Python
are those specifically interested in writing code for games. Just about
everyone could benefit greatly from taking this course.

                    Excellent instruction, excellent examples, excellent course overall. More
focus should be spent on maths in the first three weeks, but from week four
the professors incorporate formulas in the games and address all the necessary
maths to complete the mini-projects successfully. Professors Warren and Rixner
were the stars of the course, and their dynamic ""rivalry"" made watching the
lessons seem more like a tv show than studying a course. Professor Greiner is
a bit dry initially, but once you warm up to his teaching style it is
endearing. His videos were easy to grasp. Sometimes the course was incredibly
difficult, other times it was incredibly easy. It was hard to judge at a
glance which mini-project would be difficult. I would have preferred a
weeknight due date as it would have given me the weekend to do the course and
I could have focused on my work and life during the week. But as soon as I had
a day off the project was due the same day and I found all my Saturdays were
spent in front of the computer for pretty much the full 8 weeks. Quite a few
students mentioned not finishing their projects due to running out of time;
that full-time workers don't have weekdays to do the course might have
contributed to this. I would highly recommend this course because you do know
enough Python to do whatever you wish with the language, of course more study
is required, but overall as Professor Rixner states, you learn enough to be
dangerous. Thanks professors for such a great course! S.W.

                    I had no experience in this subject when i decided to learn Python from this
course. I was not looking out for other courses on the same subject, and so i
am not able to compare with one. I should thank Mr. Joe and Mr.Scott and also
the people behind this video classes, for a wonderful, effective and efficient
course plan and successful execution. Hats off!

                    I had very little experience (rusty, too) with programming but I very much
enjoyed this course. I'm a bit of a coursera junky, and this class is probably
in my top 3 favorite -- across all subject areas. I enjoyed coming home from
work and listening to the lectures, that often made me laugh out loud. I liked
to be challenged and to think in new ways, and all the while just have fun.
Joe Warren, Scott, Rixner, and John Greiner were so great and they have a
light-hearted and welcoming approach to teaching a fun programming language.

                    Before this class I had some experience with programming and even less with
python. This class has an excellent structure; lectures tie in very well with

looking at you object oriented programming), but only until I finally
understood what it was about, from there on it was much clearer. The forum
discussions and the help provided by the lecturers helped a lot.

more to learn form taking this class. They create a great environment that

                    Loved this interesting, fun, very challenging course. I am one of those
newbies to programming that the course welcomed. The structure of the class -
a new game project each week that incorporated the lecture info - was
perfectly suited to the subject matter. The first week was a breeze and each
new project built on the skills learned in the previous week. The professors -
Scott and Joe - are very good at explaining concepts new to me. All the
supplemental materials and the frequent (but not too frequent) communications
were helpful and made me feel a part of a community. The video competition is
a very nice addition for those who had the additional time... watching them
was very helpful with the projects. Overall, I highly recommend this course -
for folks new to programming as well as those who already know a programming
language. They will never be bored :)

                    This has been the best ever learning experience in programming for me! Taking
this class gave me some hope, that programming classes can be fun, even when
you are actually studying! But that does not mean you will pass this course
easily - if you are a novice, then you really should try to keep you
motivation high. As some students say, this course is quite fast-paced (it's
true for me too). What I've found very helping - is the course forum! When in
trouble with an assignment or understanding some certain topic, I've got
answers or ideas how to tweak the code to make it work - on the discussion
forum! The teachers use video-lectures very effectively (e.g., the week
material is chopped into short videos on specific topic, which makes them
easier to digest or re-watch if needed) and ... they are different persons
with own style of teaching (and they even have battle tournaments!!)), which
kind of helps staying interested and connected to the course. A rare occasion,
when it's not like ""Many commanders sink the ship"", but when they all keep the
thing working). Kudos and a big TY to teachers!

                    I just completed this class and I have to say, it was a wonderful experience.
In comparison to other online courses I've taken in the technology field, this
class is far better than most. The teachers are engaged and passionate. The
lessons give you the tools you need to be successful. The assignments were (at
least for me) very challenging, and really cemented the week's lessons. I
found myself exclaiming vocally when the code I wrote came to fruition! My
experience was fairly beginner. I have done some Javascript and a little Java,
but prior to this class, I really struggled with the OO programming concepts,
which seemed so abstract to me. I am happy to say that this class really
clarified it for me and I feel much more confident.

                    Having no prior computer science experience I did not know what to expect but
I found this class to be fun, engaging week after week. The professors did a
great job trying to make the material accessible for people of varying levels
and strengths. I found myself watching videos and doing the quizzes and mini
projects week after week. I did not engage so much in the practice exercises
but used the TAs and the discussion forums to help me move along. While I
wrote MEDIUM for course difficulty, as a beginner to Python I think it was on
the harder side of MEDIUM. This is also why I put more than 12+ hours / week.
The course suggests anywhere between 6-10 hr/wk but I did not have any prior
knowledge so I found myself working late at night trying to problem solve the
mini projects. Definitely 5/5 class and would recommend it to anyone. I will
be taking the second part in the series that this faculty teaches.

                    VBA/VB is the only programming language I knew before this class. However this
course is really helping me the get to know the essential of Python, which is
data type(in my personal opinion) By doing different mini-projects, we have to
use different data types, such as list, dictionary and set. This really helps
you to get familiar with those data types and to understand how to use them.
As a result, I highly recommend this course to those who would like to learn
Python. This will be a good starting point for you!

                    An Excellent course for people who want to start learning programming, with a
very different pedagogy. Hardly any ( I am aware of only one other ) beginner
programming class concentrates on GUI basis for approaching programming. The
class really shines out by capturing a delightful application of programming
using Games that almost all of us have come across; and by empowering us to
enable building those games. It provides immense joy and a great smug-ish
satisfaction in showing off those games to our friends. The other most
important salient feature has to be CodeSkulptor, built by an instructor of
the class; which is a Python environment with a simple take on a GUI library,
letting beginners build programs with relative ease.

programming. If you want to learn all that basic stuff like if-else
statements, for loops, classes etc, it's a good start there. The course is
going from easy stuff to more complicated things. And the main point - you see
the results (funny games) immediatelly in CodeSkulptor (google this), and its
Viz mode is very helpful when you are trying to understand what's going on
under the hood. The teachers have made a fabulous work. My studies could be

                    I'm an experienced programmer. However, I have never written anything in
Python. I was curious about Python as I have watched it gain in popularity. I
decided to enroll in this course to get a feel for Python and how it works. I
also desired to do some programming more geared towards fun (games) than my
normal programming. This course was a great course. It was somewhat
challenging to experienced programmers like me. It provided open ended
projects that you could choose to enhance beyond the rubric. The quizzes check
for synthesis of the materials. The projects were fun. The pace of the program
was fine for an experienced programmer. There were a few weeks that were
easier than others so the workload did vary week-to-week. The challenge I see
in this course is the peer evaluations. There are a small minority who don't
take those evaluations serious and just click through giving full credit even
when it isn't deserved. At the same time, I think there are some who mark off
even when there isn't any need to mark off. I'm not sure if this is because
they are not able to read more advanced code or if they want your code to look
like theirs regardless of whether it works or not. Thankfully, both of these
are minor cases. Overall this is a GREAT course for beginners. Python is a
relatively easy language to learn. The instructors to a good job of keeping
the course fun. They also do a fantastic job of encouraging beginners and
challenging experienced programmers. I would recommend this course to anyone
wanting to learn about programming.

                    Good intro to Python programing. The fact that all can be done in a dedicated
on-line IDE makes things very easy. You can directly begin to learn the core
of the course : Python. Can be relatively fast paced if you have no prior
programming experience at all, but you are given all the steps necessary not

                    There is little one can find fault with this class. It was the best run course
from the many I have taken over several platforms. The subject is interesting
and useful, and is presented in the best possible way. It's clear to tell from
its polish, that the presentation of the material and course organization have
been given a lot of thought. I had some experience with Python, but this
course does not rely on it. The learning curve is extremely well thought-out.
They also have also prepared custom tools that complement the course to give
pain-free hands-on experience. The weekly assignment projects are not minimal
tech demos, but games that (especially from week 4 onwards) are really fun to
play. The staff dedication can be seen in how quickly they respond to forums
and the dedicated teams of TAs that give you tailored advice on your code. I
cannot speak highly enough of this course, and, having been a TA for another
MOOC, can appreciate the amount of work that goes into making it such a
success.

                    Excellent course! I came with some Java programming experience, but no
knowledge of Python and little experience of interactive programming. The
lecturers clearly enjoyed making the videos, but their involvement goes beyond
that, also monitoring the discussion forums and engaging directly with the
students' questions and comments. For someone with my level of knowledge, the
course could probably have been completed in 3-4 hours per week, but I was
having fun with the programming and wanted to spend longer tweaking and
testing the programs I had written. I can't recommend the course highly enough
for someone who is interested to learn python and create games. I hope there
is a follow up course - if so I will be sure to join it.

                    This class was challenging but well worth the effort. The content was well
organized and well-explained. Most of the professors were charismatic and
their personalities made the lectures entertaining. I can honestly say I
chuckled numerous times throughout my studies due to their efforts. The only
negative I can think of is that sometimes concepts that are barely touched on
are actually crucial for the implementation of a project later-on, leaving the
student with a great deal of self-study and catching up to do. I had this
problem with certain aspects of the draw function when making the Pong game.
That being said, the forums and support staff are very helpful and if you are
determined to figure things out, you will have all the resources necessary to
do so. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting
started with programming in Python, but I would also hasten recommend either a
lot of determination or some minor self-study to prepare oneself for this
course, as it moves at a brisk pace, especially if you are new not just to
Python but to programming in general.

                    While I have 16 years experience of programming in many other languages, I had
no knowledge at all of Python. This course proved to be the perfect
introduction to interactive programming in Python. The focus on creating games
made it great fun. This was the first MOOC I had taken relating to IT and
computer science. The week 0 mini-projects was a great way to learn the
mechanics of submitting and peer reviewing the mini-projects. The mix of
weekly quizzes and mini-project gave a great balance to the course work. The
video lectures were interesting and entertaining. Joe and Scott were a great

Fundamentals of Computing. Great course!

                    I loved this course. It is the best Python programming MOOC for beginners. You
will learn everything from variables until object oriented programming. I
really enjoyed this class because mini-project were challenging and Scott, Joe
and John are really good teachers. I want to thank both Joe and Scott because
you teach me how to think in objects. I was struggling with this issue, but
using game to introduce concepts, makes learning straightforward. I definitely
recommend this course. By the way, I loved CodeSkulptor because it allows me
to share my code with some friend and family without worrying about if they
had Python installed on their computers. Thanks Scott for CodeSkultor.

                    While I have been around computers most of my life, I always wanted to be a
programmer. I flunked out of university when I was younger, but wanted to try
to learn now that I am older and I have different priorities. I had never
programmed any Python before this class, but I feel pretty confident in my
skills now. No, not enough to get a job, but enough to have a solid base.
Also, I know what areas I need improvement in. The professors all have their
own styles, but each is easy to understand. They really try to put some humor
into the class and it helps. You can't say the profs don't care, as they
really try hard with the video lectures and keeping an eye on the forums. The
project game duels at the end of each week is great too. This was my first
MOOC class and I think I was lucky to get a good one to start with. The class
has been challenging for me many weeks. My wife is tired of me waiting till
Saturday to do my weekly project and then hiding away working on it. One thing
I value is knowing what my weak areas are due to the way the class was
structured and taught. I am happy with the class and proud of what I have
accomplished.

                    I am probably not the typical student for an intro to programming course, as I
am an experienced engineer with a long career in product development. I am now
in a senior leadership position, so I have no production coding
responsibilities. I am taking the course to learn a new language that is being
used in some of our new developments. Overall it is a great course, but I
wanted to highlight three particular aspects: 1) The overall approach with
humorous video lectures and the hook of creating games is very appealing for
me, and I would think the same would be true for novice programmers. Much
better than my intro back in the dark days of computing, where I learned
FORTRAN using punch cards submitted as batch jobs to an IBM mainframe. 2) The
development environment using CodeSkulptor is very simple and accessible, and
the Viz debugging mode seals the deal. No complicated installation of platform
development tools. 3) Earlier this week I finished the last mini-project. As
an old procedural programmer with years of C scars, I have previously
struggled with getting my arms around OO development. I found the examples and
mini-project to be very approachable, and I feel like I finally understand it.
A fun and interesting way to learn a language!

                    In just 8 weeks, I went from never having written a line of code to
programming basic video games. I love that I am no longer intimidated by
programming and that I saw my thought processes and fluency in Python improve
drastically. I'm a full-time mama to 3 preschoolers and I did this after their
bedtimes 3-4 nights a week. For anyone interested in programming, this is an
EXCELLENT course. The instructors do a great job with course and tool design,
breaking everything down into manageable pieces, and the forums are active and
supportive. I'm married to a really great programmer -- he's really great, but
he's really great at programming, too -- and in his opinion Python was a good
choice for a first language to learn. I like that I can transfer these skills.

                    I think this is really a great way to begin learning about programming. I'd
been doing a bunch of non-mook online text based courses and I'd made a small
amount of progress over a long time. This mook however provided me with the
community and support to wrap my head around some of the concepts which
previously had eluded me. I can honestly say this course has given me a solid
foundation in Object Oriented Programming in Python. I don't think it's
possible to understate the benefit of the community aspect of this course and
the peer review structure...scoring other students work is probably what
helped me the most because it gave me a broad cross section of different
coding styles and ways of solving coding problems.

                    Loved this class! I honestly wish it didnt have to end. The projects were
challenging but always fun. Every single week you are building a game as a
project. You'll be pleasantly surprised by what you're capable of after this
class. By the end of this course, you'll be able to build a full working
version of the arcade game asteroids. Joe, Scott and John are great teachers.

                    This class is great. It has fun and engaging videos and not those boring
videos where someone is just reading you a powerpoint. It has lots of
examples, quizzes as well as mini-projects to get your hands dirty. Although
this class is not a walk in the park, I think it is doable for everyone
interested in learning Python or programming in general. If you're still in
doubt, don't! Just sign up: it's free and if you want a verified certificate
it will cost you only about 50 dollars. Your teachers Joe, Scott and John are

                    This is probably the best computer programming class I have taken. Had this
been my first programming class I would have majored in computer science! The
professors are all very knowledgeable, dynamic and have created a set of fun,
fast-paced videos that teach a surprising amount of coding techniques in just
eight weeks. The staff must spend a tremendous amount of time responding to
the dozens of forum questions posted every day..and the games are great! P.S.
count on 12+ hours a week, if you are new to programming. With some
experience, the lessons took 5-7 hours for the first 4 weeks. The last
projects took considerably longer.

                    This is the best course on Python I ever came across. The difficulty level
increases as the course progress, but thats how we are going to improve
logical thinking and fine tune our brain. Even though I got frustrated in
completing some complex algorithms, but realized how easy it was once I
completed. So, its all about logical thinking that is much needed to grow in
career. I recommend this course to everyone who is interested in programming
even though they do not know Python before taking the course.

and working with each other. Excellent way for experienced systems programmers
(non-OOP, all C/Assembly/etc.) to pick up on Object Oriented Concepts in a FUN
way. Also, if you're a traditional systems developer, the projects are
interactive and are also a fun new way of programming. Excellent for total
new-comers as well - it just may take a little more time during each week.
Can't say enough good things...it was just what I needed. I'd recommend it to

                    Great class with great teachers. Only had minimal Python experience, but have
learned other languages before. They had a good approach and were able to
convey the information easily for the weekly assignments. Those of which were
very well laid out and broken down in easier to bite steps with a clear
grading rubric to aim for. On top of that, they have their own cloud-based
compiler from which to save, run and share with others. Highly recommended for
anyone looking to learn programming for the first time or to add it to their

the programming world. The course areas are well organized and professors
really strive to make funnier classes, capturing more student attention. All
materials needed for this course are provided via Web, so any software
installation is required. Students will learn the basic of interactive Python
programming by building attractive games, that can be applied in other

                    Great course with great teachers. Especially good for people with minimum
programming experience. For professionals in other languages, this course
might be too easy. But is it definitely worth taking if you want to learn
Python.

                    Prior to this class my programming experience was limited to excel (I had a
VBA programming class in college), and this was the third time I tried to
enroll in MOOC, but the first time that I actually completed the course. The
video lectures are a lot of fun, and very beginner friendly. You can examine
the code used in the lecture, so if you don´t understand something just play
around with it until it clicks, they offer plenty of optional examples and
practice exercises, in addition to the mandatory quizzes (that are an awesome
tool to review and develop your knowledge) and mini-projects. The teachers are
great, in particular Scott Rixner, who developed CodeSkulptor, the amazing
programming tool used in this class.

                    Short review: This course is the best course about python ever. Kind of long
review: This course takes what you need to learn about programming and makes
it fun, the teachers are great, they are really fun but stay focused on what
you need to learn; The mini projects are the main thing about this class and
what makes it different form all the other MOOCS I've taken, they are really
fun to make and you actually use all the things that you know and feel really
rewarded when you finish it. Seriously, if you want to learn about python, and
even computer science, take this course, I fully recommend it.

basic enough that you would be able to do it all without actually knowing how
to do computer programming. It is fun and engaging. Highly recommend this if
you want to learn programming or learn Python (or both).

                    I have no prior experience in programming in Python and while this is the
first class that I've taken, it has also been one of the best classes that
I've seen on coursera. The lectures are short and to the point while also
throwing in some humor to keep things interesting along the way. There are
sections in the class where it's more difficult than most. I would say
anything with mouse clicks still boggles my mind. The TAs are great, the peers
were great in providing help, overall I would recommend this class to anyone
who wants to learn Python but has never done any coding in their life.

                    An excellent fun course which gives a very good grounding in python. Unusual
in that it teaches the language around gaming, building up from simple text
games to more complex graphic games. Coding can be entered and run via the web
browser (codeskulptor), running on the providers servers For projects, boiler
plate code (templates) is provided to get you started on a project with
suggested routes and way points to final solutions. Any maths required for a
given project are explained and formulas given. Delivery is relaxed, not a
PowerPoint presentation in sight, with lecturers on screen at all times
explaining concepts and ideas so no disembodied audio tracks! Another unusual
aspect to the course are peer reviews and marking of submitted projects by
fellow students. Useful in giving visibility of other students solutions and
quite often more ""efficient"" solutions than your own. Also videos provided on
programming errors and possible solutions. Fully supported by student forums
and code clinics. Highly recommended for beginners to more competent
programmers with an interest in an introduction to interactive programming

                    I have to say that CodeSkulptor really made this course (well, along with the
great instructors too...). I took a few other MOOC programming courses, and
the trouble of trying to get all the students to install the same version so
that written code will be able to be 'safely' executed and evaluated seemed
difficult and used precious time and resources. This made it easy, and gave
everyone the same tools, modules, and platform to start from. Truly an
invaluable tool. Also, the progression, and pace of the course, and choice of
games to program keep me thoroughly entertained and constantly learning and
improving. Really a great job! Thank you.

                    I always thought that learning code will be a boring experience but this class
kinda proved me wrong. A class that tells you that you will be making a fully
functional game 8 weeks later is very tempting. The class is well-structured
and the teachers are great, especially Joe and Scott's 'game rivalry'. The
assignments are progressively harder but doable. Another good aspect of this
class is that they make you grade your peers assignments, and that gives you
the opportunity of seeing others people perspective towards the same problem
and probably find out a good thing or two to implement in your future
assignments. Overall, the class is good and fully recommended.

                    I come from a background in Perl programming, so in theory, this course should
have been less fun. However, I found this course extremely enjoyable and have
learned many new concepts. I especially liked the object oriented which was
new to me ( as Joe Warren said - ""like driving on the left hand side "" , takes
some adjustments , but afterwards you get the hang of it!) I enjoyed the mini-
projects , even the basic ones , not to mention the advanced projects which
were awesome ! I must add that , Joe Warren and Scott Rixner , are one of the
best teaching crews I encountered ! This is how teaching should look like! You
can see the passion for programming and their efforts to pass a clear message
. One word - incredible ! They deserve it ! I just hope that there are other
courses that they teach !

based method to program. I read many books about Class programming, non of

                    I was a complete beginner in programming, and was really scared when I started
taking this class. I was worried it was going to be boring and un-engaging
like most ""course"" I had to take up at work. However I have made it through
the class, made 7 games and best thing is I managed to get all of them to
work! It was a real joy and sense of accomplishment! I think all the teachers
behind this course really put together a very well thought out course,
delicately balanced, between just-in-time scaffolding and challenges
appropriate for the learner. Scott and Joe's sense of humor, and how they
bothered to plant easter eggs in their lecture, really makes taking its video
lecture fun! The support provided for this class is also very sufficient, with
a forum, code clinic, support email and the TA who work very hard to try and
help out in the forum. The classmates in this community are also supportive
with their positive comments, sharings on the forum and helping each others

feature of this course is the very well-signposted programming exercises.
Instead of them asking you to ""Program Pong"" and leaving you to get stuck,

programming skill (and not in Python either). I found the most enjoyable
things about this class are the mini-projects where you're supposed to build
games. The satisfaction you get from completing a project is very rewarding. I
also have to give props to the professors teaching the class, esp Joe and
Scott. They did excellent job explaining things. Also, the discussion forum is
a great place to be when you're stuck and need answers. The people are very
helpful, and some of them are programmers so they know more than other
students. Overall, I recommend this course to everyone who likes challenge,
problem-solving, or just interested to learn how to program.

programming route of python. Lectures are easy enough to follow for a starter
but not too much as for a more experienced programmer to find them annoying.

videos a bit long (or many separate videos), they are worth watching and

explain things very clearly and have really given me a solid Python foundation

                    I didn't start from zero, but the most complex thing I knew about programming
was defining a function. This class did an incredible job in teaching us the
fundamentals in a very fun way. We made incredible games, albeit with the help
of professors. But I think the most I got out of this class was learning to
stick with it. There were so many times where I wanted to throw in the towel.
With the help of the lectures and the forum I was able to complete this class.
If you are those that think learning the basics (what is a variable, string,
function, loop, conditional, etc) is such a drag, I recommend this class. The
professors do a great job in blending basics with the projects at hand. For
example, we didn't learn about loops or lists right away, we learned them at a
later stage when the programs we had to write called for them.

to write games in python, it's really so much more. A great introduction to
programming in general, and to python specifically, the course covers the
basics of programming in a fun and intuitive style. I'd had a little self

training, including an introduction to OOP. If you're deciding to take it or
not, just take a look at these reviews and you shouldn't doubt any longer.

                    This was an truly excellent course - the instructors are interesting to listen
to and keep the videos entertaining but they also get their points across
clearly and fully explain what needs to be done. The course revolves around
the completion of a mini-project each week (8 in total) and each week you were
provided with a template to work from and very clear description of what
needed to be done to complete the program - this approach took away a lot of
the ""where do I even get started"" issues which I have found when programming
in the past. The videos explain the coding constructs needed to build each
program and build up from a very simple console based game to a fully animated
asteroids clone. The forums for this course were also excellent - you could
email your code to a code clinic if you got really stuck and the instructors &
TAs were very involved on the forums (which is particularly impressive given
that the session I took was the 4th time they'd run the course) I would
recommend this course to anyone who is interested in programming, whatever
your experience (or lack thereof). I had not programmed for almost 10 years,
and never in python, and I found this a great way back into the subject.

programming class. I had some experience in programming but that was really
too little and I would only imagine to build these kind of games which I built
in this class. Professors were very kind, wise and really good at introducting
the ideas and implementing them to my mind. One of the greatest achievement of
the class, I think, it gives you enough knowledge and experience that you can
exceed what you were taught and do a lot of things that can be done with a
programming language. I have enough confidence to build a game if I really
want to. I'd like to thank Joe, Scott and all the people that behind the

                    This course is extremely well-developed. All the game development takes place
on CodeSkulptor built by Scott Rixner, which I must say is a magnificent piece
of work. The course material is well laid out, and promises you to teach you
to build a game almost from scratch, even if you are a beginner to programming
or Python. I have had experience with Python, however, I never could get into
OOP. This course does a wonderful job at helping me figure out OOP (although
it can be reasonably difficult for a fresher in this topic), specially since
OOP is the crux of games. The mini-projects are fun. The guidelines for peer-
grading are such that you can innovate as much as you want as long as your
work satisfies the rubric specified. Recommended for everyone. Go on! Start

                    I've programmed in embedded C for many years and more recently have dabbled in
Objective-C. I always wanted to learn Python though so took the opportunity to
learn it on this course. In summary it's superb, a great learning opportunity
and a ton of fun to participate in. The main reasons in my opinion are: 1) The
instructors are hugely likeable, engaging, witty and committed to the extent
that they spend hours helping out on the class forums 2) It's very hands on,
the weekly quizzes are challenging and require you to really understand the
material being studied and the weekly programming assignments reinforce this.
3) The Code Skulptor environment is ideal for learning, easy to setup and
understand and allows you to quickly get to work rather than waste time on
tools. 4) The weekly programming assignments form the bulk of the work and see
you develop increasingly sophisticated games such as Pong, Memory, Blackjack
and culminating in Asteroids. These are all fun projects and just enough
template code is given so that you never feel out of depth or lost and if you
do the forums are a great place to seek help. I believe this team is going on
to do some more Coursera CS courses so I hope to find time to take those as
I'm sure they'll be of a similar quality.

beforehand and found the course challenging, yet possible with the superb
guidance of the teacher team, who really looked to have an amazing time as
well. Newbies within programming or people whose math skills are as rusty as
mine may equally find it challenging. Experienced programmers may not find
much new on the programming side; however, they will find a lot of learning
about teaching the topic itself and about how to offer on-line courses
Overall: The quality of the teaching was top notch. The materials and tools
were just brilliant. The community they managed to establish around the course
was excellent. Learning was top quality. All in all a top grade for this

                    I really think that programming courses are where Coursera shines. Both the
auto-graded quizzes and the peer-reviewed projects are at their best when the
subject being taught is practical and complex. This is a very polished
introductory course, all in all enjoyable. The only critics I have are the use
of a custom made library and programming environment, which make it harder to
take the lessons learned ""out into the world"". Aside from that, the course is
fun and challenging without ever being frustrating. (I also completely ignored
the practice exercises and Viz mode, so this review concerns only the 'core'
lessons, the quizzes and the mini-projects)

was so much fun and very efficient and useful, I am ever so grateful to the
developers. This is also the first course I have ever completed, usually I
quit for whatever reason. Total beginners might have to work hard, but it is
still manageable - the teaching team is simply awesome! I will continue
studying with the next course ""Principles of computing"". The course structure,
the contents, the instructors and the way they present the material are truly
excellent. I can recommend it to people with little-to-no experience in
programming, and not only to those who are interested in games, the whole
package I have learned can be applied anywhere in the interactive programming.

                    This class is so much fun! Creating a game, and that satisfaction you get once
you create a game is what makes this course worth it. I have experience in
other programming languages. Comparing to others languages, python is very
straight forward. So i found it easy to accept whatever the teachers taught.
However i'm sure first timers will face some difficulty, but trust me its
worth it. And as for the difficulty, the discussion forums help every one to
manage through out the course. Listen to them, listen to the given
instructions for the mini-project, and you'll get through. The teachers are
very very friendly, very supportive, in fact i'm so hooked on with their
courses that i have already enrolled their up coming class 'Principles of
Computing'. These are great teachers. I have to be honest, this is the first
class that i have completed. I usually join classes, and quit in the middle
either because i dont think its worth my time or its not my domain of
interest, or simply because its boring. However this class is just
interesting. And definately worth taking.

                    This was a great course. The teaching style and videos were enjoyable. The
content was well-explained and had more than enough material to be able to
complete the assessments. Everything was easy to follow and understandable.
The mini-projects were fun and gave a sense of accomplishment in what was
produced, especially the final project which was to create a game of
Asteroids. I've programmed in other languages before so I didn't find the
course very hard, but I think it might be a challenge for people who are
totally new to programming especially since it goes into object-oriented
stuff. Some of the projects had a bit of math knowledge in them (trig and
motion stuff) which some people might find daunting if they do not have the
background. You'd be ok if you were solid with high school level stuff. The
course is fairly time intensive, you will need to have a few hours spare each
week to spend on the assessment items and the deadlines are weekly so falling
behind isn't a good option. I haven't taken any other courses but I can't
imagine that many are better than this one. There wasn't anything I disliked
about the course.

experience with Python, event driven programming, and object oriented

mini-projects and quizzes were just the right difficulty and pace. The video
lectures were very engaging, clear and concise - I found myself looking

course to learn to write programs that don't look like they're 20 (or 30)
years old. I was delighted. The instructors are great; they show amazing
dedication, prowling the discussion forums even late at night on weekends.
While it may work best for students with some prior programming experience,
the course is a great chance to develop interactive programming skills, and
the lectures are a lot of fun.

                    I already had a fair amount of experience with scripting in python, as well as
bash, and ruby. So I knew what I was getting into, I took the course
specifically to learn gui programming in python. While the course focuses on
writings simple games in python with fairly scaled down versions of both
python and a gui library written specifically for this course, it will help
you write programs well beyond simple games. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.
Learned alot about gui programming in python and python in general. I would
reccomend this course to anyone who already had a little knowledge about
programming or scripting, as it is fairly fast paced. I can see how someone
who never wrote one line of code, could lag behind towards the end of this
course. That being said, if you have plenty of time to devote to this class
then you can go from absolutely no experience at all to passing this course.
Its a great course. I'm taking the next one in the series, called ""Principles
of Computing"" coming in a few weeks. The support structure and info is all top
notch. Enjoy python!

programming classes (C++ and Java) but I had not really nailed all the
concepts properly. Besides this I also took the MOOC of Computer Networks from
Coursera and Washington University, compared to that one this class has a
better structure and is less complicated. This course was a huge help in order
to properly understand the basics of GUI programming and OOP. The class has
been planned really carefully and it's designed to make students learn,
theres' support via emails and on the forums, besides the lectures are always
clear and helpful. I would like to thank Coursera and Rice University, the
teachers and assistance for putting this together, it was really helpful to me
and will help me with my professional career from now on. I'm 32 years old,

                    I watched U of Tronto's Python course before taking this course. I also took a
course from Udacity. In terms of this course, the videos are well made.
Teachers are great at teaching programming. They were more available than the
CS teachers at my university, and their TA's were very kind. It was very, very
helpful to watch teachers actually writing codes and debugging codes for real.
The development steps were also very helpful. Without them, I couldn't even
have begun any of the assignment games. The example codes and exercises were
also very helpful in doing assignments. The two things that I'm not satisfied
about is that it did teach us about the web application. The games we created
lives only within CodeSkulptor. Also, it doesn't have part 2. I want this
class to keep going and show us more advanced game codings. My big thanks to
all teachers, TAs, and everyone in the forum. You guys rock!!

课程很有意思，老师也很可爱。如果你是一个生活大爆炸的粉丝（比如我），那么就更要参加这门课程了。 不过话又说回来，对于我大天朝来说，这么课唯一让人觉得难受的就
是GFW对于Codeskulptor的惠顾了。很多课程需要用到的材料都放在谷歌的云存储上，结果就是国内访问的时候问题不断，很头疼。因此，自备翻墙工具是必须的
。有时候只有有线网才能载入代码，有时候载入不了的图片需要改成https的链接（注意是https 而不是 http）。所以，方校长去死！
总之，这门课非常好，尤其适合初学者。比如我这样平时生活和编程没什么大关系的人都坚持下来了，还是很好的。
那些和我一样学文科类的专业，然后平时上课压力不大的，强烈建议多上几门公开课吧。或者为字幕组贡献下力量也可以。字幕组和教授们一样伟大。 感谢那些帮助过我的人！

                    I had no prior programming experience with python. This is the first online
course I have ever taken. I have a degree from more than 20 years ago and saw
this and thought I'd give it shot because prior programming experience was not
required. I like the course because I was able to do things a slower pace,
specifically being able to take my time with quizzes and projects. I had a
dislike which eventually became a like and that was the video lecture / quiz /
assignment requirements and the structure needed to stay on task. As a
historically disorganized person, I learned how to become a more organized,
focused person following this course structure. Though I really felt like I
was in over my head at times, I would most definitely recommend this class to
anyone with any skill level. It's worth it!!! Thanks Joe, Scott and John for

                    Before this course, I know nothing about python, this class is very funny and
I can learn the grama of this language. the homework is also very interesting
and makes me better understand what I've learned. The template makes us more
easy to complete the course, thanks for joe and scott, and all the team
working for the spread of programming.

have done. The instructors were great. Corny jokes but a real pleasure to
watch the videos. Sad that it's over. Only suggestion for the next course

                    This is a pretty fantastic introduction to python. The workload has a nice
curve to it so things start off light and gradually become lengthier,
resulting in projects in the back half of the class that take more than a few
hours and require quite a bit of attention to complete. I'm not sure I'd
recommend this class to someone with an exceptionally busy schedule or someone
who is already taking a number of school courses but if you aren't already
overwhelmed and you're looking to figure out how programming works and where
you can start, this is the place to be.

                    Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (IIPP) was fantastic. I have
dabbled with JavaScript making rollovers in HTML, but otherwise have never
coded before. I was doing the Java programming course at the Khan academy at
the same time as doing IIPP and I dropped Khan (though it was easier) as I was
getting confused between the two different languages, and I was enjoying
Python course much more, as I was making fun games as well as learning. I
thoroughly enjoyed coding each of the Mini Projects, then got the joy of
playing the games after I had finished building them. If I had a challenge
with part of the code, I would just need to go to the forums and I would
usually find that someone else was struggling with the same section of code as
I was and that there were many others offering helpful hints on how to work
out what was needed. I also found that the practical exercises (with
solutions) were a great help as each weeks exercises were examples similar to
what was needed for the Mini Project, and I could look at the exercise
solution code, make some adjustments (IE it wasn't just a straight copy and
paste) for what was needed in the mini project. The practical exercises were
also great for improving my coding style. Early in the course I would often do
an exercise and achieve the required outcome, then look at the solution and
see 3 lines of code where I had needed 5 or 6. Later in the course I could
mostly get the solution with similar amounts of code. Overall I would Highly
recommend IIPP for anyone who is interested in a great introduction to a
programming language, with little or no prior experience.

                    Excellent, excellent, excellent course in programming. I would recommend this
as a starting point before someone jumps further into other more advance
languages like Java and C# or C++. The projects and practice exercises are
structured in such a way that re-enforcing the lectured materials and hard-
wire the programming concepts in brain. Rice University also offers more
advance CS courses as part of the same series. I have glanced through the
material and these appears to carry over the same high quality.I would
definitely recommend those if someone is looking to pursue further heavy
courses in math and programming (like some courses offered online by MIT and
Stanford University) At the very last, if I have to choose the best aspect of
this course (among many excellent aspects), this will be the way the mini
projects were broken down. All of the mini projects were true and vivid
examples of how to move from the ""large & complex"" to something that we can
observe and comprehend the ""internal circuitry"". How to first code the simple
operation and then ""care"" about the more complex functions. How to compose a
""skeleton"" programming structure and then flesh it up. And although many
different implementations can equally work, after following and completing the
structure based on the recommendations, it becomes all apparent why it was
more efficient to group the code together (as per suggestions). In particular,
the OPP-driven projects were excellent in demonstrating how to group the code
in such way so additional requests for functionality can easy be accommodated
without the need to discard code and start from scratch again.

                    I had no prior experience in computer programming and I found this course
difficult. The pace was too fast for me. I managed to keep up, but this
involved putting in about 15 hours a week, which was about double the amount
of time I had allocated for it. The course is fun, and I got a great feeling
from completing it. This course is much faster-paced than Charles Severance's
Programming For Everyone (coursera), which I took concurrently. Programming
For Everyone may be a better course for you if you're an absolute beginner as

                    I took this course with my 12 year old daughter and loved it! From basic
variables and data structures to OOP, this course covered multiple topics in a
well-thought out and developed them over several weeks with mini-project
reinforcement. My daughter had only minor exposure to scratch prior to this
class. Now she has learned to ""think"" imperatively and logically as well as
program in python. I just installed anaconda on her PC and we look forward to
playing with pygame and pyglet. This is one of the best MOOCs out there, and
we're looking forward to taking the continuation of this course.

                    This is a great course for a beginner wanting to learn programming and Python!
I have no prior programming experience, and had heard of Python as a higher
level programming language. I took it because I love computers and technology
in general, but do not have any understanding on what goes on behind the
scenes. I figured I had to start somewhere and this was my first step towards
understanding that... The instructors of this course are great! The lectures
are nicely paced, aimed at beginners but when you listen to them carefully,
there's a lot one can learn reading between the lines and looking up
recommended reading, which is also free and available in the course. As far as
the grading goes, there are usually two multiple choice question format
quizzes (not timed) that students need to submit. These are very clearly and
cleverly formulated, which make the student go back to their notes, to
documentation, and make sure that s/he has really understood the topic about
which the question is asked. The quizzes are computer graded and one can
attempt each quiz upto 5 times without a penalty. (best of all attempts is
considered as effective score). There is also an a programming assignment each
week - these are the most exciting and practically useful, but also difficult
part of the class. However, there's plenty of help to start with - a
recommended programming template, forums, documentation guidance and above all
- email support from the course TA's which very few or no MOOC classes offer.
The assignments are peer graded and self-graded, and the grading rubric is
VERY clear, making it extremely effective and unambiguous to grade peers. All
in all, it was a great class for me, and I plan to continue to build my
knowledge of programming and Computer Science as a hobby. I would HIGHLY
RECOMMEND this class to any beginner who wishes to understand programming,
including basics of object-oriented programming. Best luck!

in learning something about object oriented programming and classes. The
computer games projects that are the focus for this course are a terrific
vehicle for digging into these topics. The quizzes of which there were one or
two per week, prepared the student for the weekly project. It was a lot of fun
to learn in the system that Coursera and the Rice University professors have
created. I have done extensive Matlab and Fortran scientific programming in
the past. This course provided a painless, fun resource for gaining experience
with Python and with basic object oriented programming. A great experience.

                    RE: An introduction to Interactive Programming in Python I've been programming
since 1982, professionally in the computer industry since 1991 (BASIC, M,
C/C++, Java) and found this course to surpass anything I've experienced to
date. The framework combining short lectures, quizzes, mini projects with
frequent peer and self reviews firmly drives home the new information. The
interactive forums are both inspiring and entertaining. They are also very
helpful to anyone struggling to complete an assignment and must drastically
reduce the dropout rate. The CodeSkulptor tool makes this course unique. The
ability to develop, run and debug your code directly in your web browser,
without installing any Python development kit, is a huge bonus. This also
makes reviewing your peer's code a doddle. This also means you can share your
completed projects with anyone that has access to the web! The final, and
probably most important, key to the effectiveness of this training method is
the presentation of material. The lectures are short, the presenters really
know the material and are engaging and personable. The humorous banter between
them makes one look forward to the next video. (Warning: this course can be as
addictive as your favorite soap opera or situation comedy!). Seriously though,
the professors and lecturers are those you wish you'd had at your university.
I highly recommend this course to anyone wishing to learn Python or
programming in general. Unless you are already a Python guru, you will learn a
lot in a very short time and have great fun in the process. So, if you are
hesitating, wondering if this course is for you.... enrole immediately. You'll
be glad you did.

interested in starting to learn programming. Eight weeks duration is just the
right length and keeps you going even when you have little time. The main
benefit is that you can start directly without first downloading and
installing software. No need to learn complicated menus and software only to
write your first “Hello World” program. For example getting started with
Visual Studio, installing it, learning how to navigate around is a big effort.
Using Simple-GUI and getting all software tools you need to do the course is a
big relive. Thanks to the team, the teachers, the university and all the
dedicated people that made this “FREE” course possible.

                    I had some basic knowledge of Python before, so most of the material here was
not new for me, but I still learned a lot. I cherished the opportunity to work
in a project-based way, creating small games. A fun and very concrete way to
learn. Big thumbs up to the professors too. They are obviously passionate and
they have a very clear and entertaining way of teaching the subject. I liked
it so much that I'm even going to take the follow-up course! Highly

                    This is the first full-fledged MOOC I took (not counting some shorter
Codecademy and Treehouse tracks), and I must say I'm genuinely and positively
surprised. The learning experience is excellent, the tasks and problems are
engaging, instructors (Scott, Joe and John) are wonderful, and the lectures
are filled with a sort of geek humor I like a lot. The pace is perfect, there
wasn't a time when I was stuck, and on the other hand, I felt I was really
working on problems, not just breezing through. Perhaps I was the right
audience for the course - I haven't had any serious experience with
programming previously (I tried to code in Basic some twenty years ago, and I
took a short Codecademy Python introductory track a couple of weeks before
this Coursera course - and that was more than enough). So thanks to Coursera,
thanks to Rice University, thanks to Joe, Scott and John. By the way, Rice has
two more Python courses on Coursera that are more advanced. I haven't took
them yet but after this class I'm definitely going to.

                    I have taken several MOOCs on Python now, but this one was one of the most
fun, both because of the teaching styles and the projects that were built. I
would not say this is the only Python course anyone needs, but this one is
invaluable for the experience you will get in graphical and interactive
programming, learned through writing video games. The first time I tried the
course, the subjectivity of ""peer grading"" was annoying, but the professors
have greatly improved this feature with grading rubrics that focus on what
really needs to be in the program.

                    I had little prior experience with Python and programming in general. I took a
couple of courses on other websites and I pretty much new the basics. But it
was never enough! I had yet to find a course that would actually teach me how
to apply the things that I learn to real world applications until IIPP came
along. On-line courses usually have projects in the form of basic exercises
and problems which is good, it helps you test what you've learned but after a
point it becomes boring. This course was based around what is called event
driven programming and around building games which as you can imagine, was
awesome. We built actual 2D games and we didn't even have to download anything
or anything like that thanks to this feature called Codeskulptor. It's
available for everyone on codeskulptor.org and it's an amazing editor built by
one of the professors teaching the class, Scott Rixner. All of the teachers
are amazing, they are very friendly and they actually care about the students
very much. They are monitoring the forums so they can help as many people as
possible in the best of ways. The community's TA's also put their hand in that
as well of course providing help to anyone who requires it. Lastly, I want to
emphasise on how this course does things differently from any other course I
have ever seen. If you would like to join I can assure you that even if you
are a complete beginner or an expert you are going to learn a lot and above
all, you are going to have much much fun while doing it.

however gained un-systematically. I came to this course with the aim of
learning Python while learning the concepts of computer science in a more
systematic manner. In my estimation this course was fantastic ! It is by far
the best MOOC course that I have ever taken. This course was exceptionally
well put-together and was very enjoyable. There was a whole host of practice
examples and exercises that helped with learning the various concepts being
introduced. The concepts were introduced methodically and systematically and
the discussion forums were exceptionally useful. The Instructors were very
involved in the forums and were not ""phoning it in"" as some MOOC instructors
tend to do. In summary, I would give it 5 out of 5!

                    I started programming back in the 70's when it was done on a VAX - what I
remember most was that groups of us would code together. We would spent nights
writing code and then executing it.That was what made it so fun. This class
captures that spirit. Its an excellent environment for introducing students to
some very difficult concepts that 95% of programming classes will never
achieve. You will not get another class as good as this with all the
extracurricular support provided by staff and students. I learned a lot about
programming style from watching and learning how other students tackled these
problems. Don't forget to utilize the concepts page with sample projects and
the student videos were excellent. There was so much to view that I never had
time to take another class.

                    I've programmed for 25 years, on a do-what's-needed basis. This is my first
taste of Python, and it was an excellent introduction, thoughtfully designed
and just at the right level to suit as many people as possible. Instructors
are truly dedicated and fun, and the community was one of the best, supportive
and always ready with an answer. Very highly recommended.

the course at codecademy.com. I found this course to be fairly easy yet I
still felt like I was learning a lot. The course is laid out very well and it
really kept my interest. I found myself completing all the work for the week
on the first day it was released then anxiously awaiting the next weeks
material. The instructors are great and do a great job explaining everything.
I would recommend this course to anyone interested in python or just
programming in general.

my experience in programming was poor. Only some C programs to compute air
navigation data and SQL. I have to say, after completing this amazing course,
that I feel good, proud and happy. The professors are brilliant, fun,
enthusiatic, smart and charismatic. The lessons are extermely accurate, the
quizzes are a good example to test your level and the development of the mini
projects have been really interesting. The discusions at forums and the help
of some other students have been massive and great. A very good experience if
you want to know the basic of a new language programming, from the global
varibles and the structured code to the OOP with classes, methods and so on,
with and excelent web shell, codeskulptor, made by one of the teachers.
Really, really recommended course. A big thank you to Rice University and

                    I have just a very small training in Python. Whatever is your previous skill
(even if is '0') you will love this course. Teachers are just great and fun
but, the best, is how they paced the miniprojects every week. On these mini
project you'll develop funny games (including a shoot'em up spaceship one) to
learn step by step the fundamentals of Python power. And yes, at the end, as
one of the teacher says you will be really dangerous (or in the way to be).
You only need to be aware that the deadline for the miniproject is quite tight
(in my case, central Europe time) 7AM sunday that practically means finishing
it by the end of saturday. So watch the quite short video trainings at the
beginning of the week, do the quizzes afterwards and start the miniproject by
thursday afternoon if possible. That gives you time to face programming issues
you may find.

                    This class was awesome. I was a little hesitant in taking an introductory
course that didn't use a 'real' IDE, but CodeSkulptor is full featured enough
that the concepts they teach you in the class are applicable once you move on
to something else (I personally use Eclipse with PyDev now). Scott and Joe are
great instructors and they do a very good job at presenting material at a
brisk pace while still offering concise explanations and demonstrations of
that material. I did have some self taught experience with Python, and that
helped mitigate the learning curve a bit. Someone starting completely fresh
(no programming experience) will probably have to work a little extra hard to
keep up for the first several weeks. Overall though, this was a fantastic
introduction to programming. You write games that you can share with your
family and friends, and it is a tremendous feeling to have them play your
games and enjoy them. It really pushes you to want to improve on the basic
versions you write in the class.

helpful for someone with no cs background. I think taking programming for
everyone before this would also be helpful, but this class covers everything
you need. Compared to online classes at many universities this class was a lot
more useful. I haven't taken many MOOCs but this class is a lot more thorough
than the others I have taken. I liked that the mini projects were games, they
really kept me motivated to finish them. Even the games that weren't that
interesting I would want to finish them so I would have the tools to make the
interesting upcoming ones.

                    I am a complete novice to programming. This was my first computer course EVER!
That is why it was hard for me. I am in my mid 40s and doing most of the
projects and some of the quiz questions were extremely difficult for me. I
plan to take this class again soon, so that I can have an easier time with it.
I probably spent 20 to 25 hours per week on this class. Just my experience. I
loved this class btw.

experience with Python already, so I knew a lot of this, but I filled in holes
here and there and learned how to tighten my code up a bit. The peer review

                    It was a great course. I have always wanted to develop games but never did
one. This course has given me the tools I needed to develop games and I would
use these skills beyond. Having said that, the course may not be appropriate
for people who want to develop a deeper knowledge in Python (especially to
those not interested in games). Well, this is my perception as the course
deals with more of events, GUI and basic data-structures but does not go to
the depths.

                    I would give the course a favorable rating from a novice Python language view
point. The course is very good in terms of quizzes and material but does
suffer from one minor issue. I had prior OO programming experience in C++,
Java as well as C# and this course has very little emphasis on that front.
This is strictly for beginners and the title of Introduction to Python matches
the content and they will most likely enjoy taking this class.

                    Python is a widely used language, which is both powerful and ""relatively"" easy
to use. There are abundant online resources to help learn the language. Many
of which do a better job and with a lot less overhead than the coursera
course. Its key distinction is that it purports to teach ""interactive""
programming. It attempts this with a proprietary (not open source like the
rest of python) library/environment called Codeskulptor. This is just another
javascript library, which runs in the browser. I would like to be able to be
more positive about the course, but it suffers from critical flaws: It's
patronizing and dumbed down from the lame jokes, weekly tee shirts, and
abbreviated discussions to the skimpy documentation. If the instructors took
the trouble to describe their programming platform more fully, one could skip
the video lectures, which are short on substance. Whatever skills and
strengths the course staff have. Teaching, or indeed public speaking are not
among them. The course was not overly difficult, but not worth the time vs.
many other online, e.g. Edx, and offline, e.g., How to Think LIke a Computer
Scientist. Their fixation on homegrown Codeskulptor environment is
unfortunate, because superior solutions with active communities are readily
available, e.g., Processing. It is indeed telling that there is no open source
community and no apparent interest in Codeskulptor. Even for free there are
better alternatives.

though the materials were pretty much the same both times,it was a pleasure
watching again those lectures and doing again those projects from scratch. I
was familiar with Python prior to the course,so i cann't really judge how easy
is for someone with no knowledge of programming or python.But it believe that
if you try hard you can complete it definetely even if you haven't seen a
Python command before. The next session is in a Specialization Track of
Coursera for programming.So another + for this course. Definetely take this
course,just for the fun of it.

                    I'm an experienced programmer and the course was intended to teach basics so
I'm probably not the best reviewer. Anyway, the course is okay but it focuses
on the wrong thing. It teaches you the python basics pretty well (variables,
control structures, functions, etc) but fails to teach object-oriented
programming. Instead of showing how to write OOP programs the course gives you
already prebuilt scripts and all you have to do is to fill in some math. The
part I disliked the most, though, is the framework they built for writing
Python code (http://www.codeskulptor.org/); you have to use it instead of
""normal"" Python IDE or libraries (they have their own GUI lib). The peer
review scoring is not related to code quality at all, so almost every time I
reviewed a peer's code I awarded it with a perfect score despite the fact the
code was far from perfect. Anyway, it's a pretty rewarding course as you're
creating a game.

                    One of the best courses I have seen till now. Very constructive, well prepared
course materials. Workload remains constant during whole course. Yet not the
hardest course, but not one of the easiest. Great start for beginners to learn
some concept of computational thinking and how python works. Really appreciate
work course staff has done.

                    With limited BASIC programming experience from the 80's, I signed up for this
class hoping to get back into coding. Wow! What a new world that opened!
Amazing professors, a message forum for help (with thousands our people
sharing what they know), and a true college level experience. This was not a
water-down, hand-you-the-answers type learning environment. You had to work
for what you completed.

                    Contents: This course is an introduction for people with very little
experience of computers. It covers the basic data types such as variable,
lists, sets and dictionaries. It also covers the basics of classes. A lot of
the time is spent dealing with their own CodeSkulptor system. This is a useful
system to allow python code to be run in a browser but it is highly non-
standard. A lot of the applications developed are concerned with writing
games. Presentation: The course is very well presented and the lectures have
an infectious enthusiasm for the subject. Resources: The resources for the
class include set practice exercises complete with starter code and complete
sample solutions. There is also a “code clinic” where the staff provide more
direct help to the students. Coursework: The coursework is based around
developing a series of progressively more complex games. A lot of the lecture
content is devoted to helping the student with these. The coursework itself is
peer assessed. Summary: Overall it is a very well produced course but it is a
little to simple and spend too much time covering the implementation of games
on the proprietary system.

came away a more confident programmer and with a better understanding of the

ppl who know a little and want to learn more. Even though i didn't understand
all of this immediatly, I still learned a trumendous amount. :D

considered learning Python using CodeAcademy but I decided to take this longer
learning route. A decision I am very happy I took. Not only did I gain a sound
foundation in Python. Not only did I learn interactive techniques that I was
able to apply to Georgia Tech's SDN class. I also learnt how to teach
programming. I am now teaching my 10 year old daughter how to write basic
Python functions using the techniques I learnt here. In short, a brilliantly
executed and presented class from skilled lecturers who love teaching computer

                    Very well structured, instructors were very motivated & responsible. It was
nice to see a team faculty effort as well. Each week's assignment was creating
a game--the plus of this is that it was always interesting & motivating, the
minus is that we had to focus a fair amount on game related code (collisions,
detecting when objects went off the screen, etc.), which, if you are
ultimately not interested in writing games, can seem a wee bit much. But
besides this minor point, the class was excellent. One super aspect of this
was that the profs created a simple, elegant online programming environment
that ran in your browser and did not require any code to run on your desktop--
which resulted in one-click code execution, not having to bother with
compilers, libraries, etc. Highly recommended!

confidence to try and keep trying. Everyone in the course--students, TAs, and
even Instructors--were very helpful. I was even able to communicate with one
of the instructors via the ""code clinic"" email system! The level of
interaction and assistance was at least as good--or even better--than what
I've experienced in regular online university courses. I have taken only one
other online programming course (also free and non-credit); of the two, this
one was the most enjoyable and supportive. I recommend this course for anyone
who hasn't had much programming experience. You may struggle, but you'll have
all the help and encouragement you need to succeed.

                    I highly recommend this class, especially to those who have always longed to
learn more about python but were too timid to jump outside the box and take a
python class - this class is for everyone. You don't need to know about python
before you take the class.

                    I took Introduction to Data Science and dropped it due to lack of Python
knowledge. So, to learn about Python, I took this course. At first it was easy
and by the end it was somewhat demanding. But loved the course, I'm even
considering retaking the course for Verified Certificate. This course has
great Instructors. Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are the best! I now feel I can
complete the Data Science class programming assignments. Verdict: A must take

appropriate pace. I started the class with no formal programming experience
though I have been involved in software development by producing 2D and 3D
graphics for quite some time. My career experience gave me a strong conceptual
understanding of the software development issues but this course gave me the
fundamental understanding that I had desired. This was my 3rd MOOC that I have

of time to complete the course and I feel that my time was well spent being

                    This was an absolutely fantastic course, I can't say enough good things about
it. This is the first course I've ever taken on programming and it's gotten me
totally hooked. The instructors were fun and personable and they delivered
their lectures with great content that was also engrossing in the way they
taught it, and with just enough humor mixed in. Codeskulptor, the in-browser
application for executing python code was well done and got the student used
to using documentation to resolve problems and was a great tool for the
course. The fact that the professors also created this tool is simply
incredible, far beyond the call of duty. The quizzes and projects were both
very informative in their own right--I didn't feel like they were a test of my
knowledge so much as another learning tool, in which the real learning took
place and I applied what I'd merely heard about in the lectures. To me this is
taking maximum advantage of the MOOC format.

                    This was my first ever experience with taking a MOOC (and the only one I've
taken so far). I took the course on a whim with absolutely ZERO prior
programming experience, and though there were certain parts that proved
challenging, I was able to complete all the assignments with full points to
earn a pass ""with distinction"". What I liked about the course is that most of
the lecture videos are relatively short (usually under 15 minutes), and the
professors Warren and Scott try to keep things entertaining, so it's not too
difficult to slog throug, though the ""Programming Tips"" videos with John were
a bit on the dry side. What's fun is that the assignments have you build
simple games, so there's a sense of accomplishment, and you get to try out
other people's versions of the games through peer assessment. Some people
really went all-out with their versions! There were a few concepts that I
didn't think were sufficiently explained in the videos (like how to use the
modulo function), but they do provide you with optional homework problems that
are a big help if you're kind of lost. And the discussion forums seem to be a
big help for some people (though I never personally needed to use it).
Overall, it was a very positive experience for me, and I felt I learned a lot
about the concepts of how to program in Python.

The course material and projects are very well thought-out and teach you a lot
of Python. Notre that the amount of time you will need to take this course
will vary widely depending on your programming experience. The mini-projects
assigned each week take a lot of work, and if you've never programmed before,
I think they will be very Hard, but they have a team of people to help you as

                    fun course, focused on developing games, can't believed I successfully
completed the last project, quite sophisticated game for an unskilled
programmer like me. The teachers are very clear about adding new concepts in
programming and give lots of support to make it a successful experience.

describe the mini projects is awesome most importantly the games between them.
The video lectures,quizzes and the mini-projects are designed in a very good
way i never felt bored while watching the videos the instructors are very
engaged in the smooth functioning of the class hope to have another course
from these fantastic instructors i really enjoyed this course

instructors and staff are great. They make the course interesting and
educational at the same time. Compared to other class, the course material is
clearer and documentation is very helpful. I like the instructors and the

make in the future.

                    I really enjoyed this class. I work in a SW group at a SF Bay area startup, so
programming is fairly intuitive to me. I always wanted to formally learn
Python in a structured environment, and after completing this course, I really
don't want to go back to C++(how I make a living). The challenge for me was
finding time to go through the quizzes and mini-projects, given my day job
that demands so much of my time. But I looked forward to working on the
projects, esp late at night. The instructors are fabulous, and really enjoy
teaching this class. Excellent content, and delivery of materials.
CodeSkulptor is awesome, though I often found myself using my emacs shortcuts
that don't work in the browser. I would highly recommend this course. My kids
have a few games to play now! I have promised them more....

                    This is a remarkable class. I write a lot of code in perl but most of my co-
workers use python, so I was looking for a fun way to learn pythons. Scott and
Joe are very entertaining instructors, and having never had any formal class
in computer science it was great to have the ideas behind so many things
explained to me. Teaching object-oriented programming in the framework of game
development is a great idea and these guys do a bang up job.

you won't fall behind... if Python is your second programming language you'll
learn a lot and appreciate all the stuff that Python handles for you

They did an excellent job that really paid off. I totally agree with other
reviewers when they say that professors seem to like teaching. In my opinion
it also made the whole learning process straightforward and fun. Most of all.
I also had the oportunity of starting from scratch and build simple and fun

                    I took many courses in my lifetime, but this one was the most fun to do yet!
Even with a medium workload, i never got the impression to be under pressure -
it was just fun sitting nighttimes until the job was done. The lectures were
at the same time educational and fun to see - the teachers seemed to have as
much fun as the pupils. At the end, everyone was a little sad it was over -
what better is there to say about a course!

                    Before I took this course, I literally knew nothing about python, and almost
nothing about programming. I have learned a lot from this course and enjoyed
it very much. The instructors are awesome. They made the learning process
entertaining and easy to follow. I got full score in every quiz and every
mini-project. For a person without any programming background, I think this is
really an achievement.

                    I have a Masters in Computer Science and 20+ years industry experience, mostly
in Software Build and Release Management. I write a lot of shell scripts and
the occasional bit of Perl code but seldom write programs anymore (used to be
fluent in COBOL, C, C++, and Java). I wanted to learn Python so I might be
able to use it in my work. This was a somewhat hard course for me because of
some of the math involved. More because I'm so removed from it now in my
career. This was stuff I knew but it was years ago. Trying to reason some of
the math needed in my head (and drawing pictures on paper) is why I spent more
time than advertised on the class. I really liked this class and the
instructors. I learned a lot and will now be able to transition that knowledge
back to the work place. It was nice to spend time actually programming again
and the projects, although challenging, were a lot of fun and the results were
great. They also gave me a chance to be a bit creative in how to accomplish
the goal. If these guys ever teach an advanced class I will be there with
bells on. Great class and highly recommended. I also want to break out some of
my neck ties in honor of Scott.

                    I had learned some Python programming on my own and, although I could code up
simple things to do math and processing of text information, I found things
like Classes and GUI programming unfathomable on my own. This course bridged
that gap and now I'm looking forward to making more progress. Difficulty was
spot-on, each project had one or two conceptual hurdles and forum help got me
there.

                    I have a bachelor of computer science and have programmed in many other
languages; so this course was quite easy for me. If you are looking at
learning Python and don't need to ramp up quickly in the language for work
purposes, then consider taking this class. The class is well organized and
each week's lecture topics provided the necessary information to be able to
complete the assignments. I liked that the instructors took the time to
develop Code Skulptor for the class because it removed the environmental
issues we might have encountered installing Python or using Python in whatever
IDE we have on our personal computers. The instructors were also very clear
about which browsers were supported by Code Skulptor. As a result, the
environmental issues were kept to a minimum and it was easy to identify a
problem as a bug in the code bugs or a gap in knowledge for a particular
concept.

and the materiel is just so well structured and relevant, that it keeps you
engaged, and you keep coming back for more - depending on your time
commitment. I say that, because, well, I can see where some may get wrapped up
in this a little too much in the beginning. If you have a job, and family,
well, that just takes time away from them, and may not be good. On the other
hand, if you can balance life activities, and squeeze in some time to take
this course, you will not be dissatisfied. I went through the codecademy.org
Python material before taking this course. I think that helped me focus on the
material presented, enough to where I was able to ask the right questions
without wasting a lot of my and others time.

                    An enjoyable and educational class. I recommend it to anyone. I came to the
class with a weak and ancient math background and a small and ancient
programming background. I found myself challenged each week but made it
through everything. I would say the 5-7 hour figure is pretty good if you have
some math background and even a little programming background. If you are
coming in completely fresh to both, figure on more time to accomplish the
work. The course is taught in a fun manner and it was easy for me to stay
attentive to the video lectures. I'm now in some other Coursera classes and
they make this class stand out even more as a pleasant, interesting
experience.

                    Fantastic class! Very well organized. The lectures are both educational and
entertaining. The combination of lectures, quizzes, practices exercises and
mini-projects provides many opportunities to gain proficiency with new
concepts. The mini-projects are a fantastic hands-on learning tool.

                    I had a basic and very recent prior knowledge of Python, mainly its syntax.
This course allowed me to have a really fun time and at the same time learn an
skill that will help me evolve professionally. The material is very good and
the teaching team make of the class something I look forward to every week,
though I have had to spend the last few Saturday nights drinking coffee to be
able to turn assignment on time, as most of my time I work as a web
consultant. My next step is using my Python skills to work with Django to
build dynamic websites. P.S. Let me tell you, you will not believe how much
python you can learn in 8 weeks developing games, and how proud you can be
when your friends spend a while playing with them. If you want to dive into
programming this course is a must.

instructors did a great job with giving the exact steps in order to accomplish
each project. I also appreciate a lot the discussion forms and whenever I got
stuck I always could search the answer there. One thing that I would like to
see an improvement is if possible to get an e-mail reminder about quizzes due
date. I was so in to the mini projects every week that I forgot to do the

                    High marks to this course and its instructors. This is a good course for those
who want to learn or re-learn Python and event driven programming no matter
your experience level. The approach of ultimately creating a game makes this
course even more enjoyable. The instructors are excellent presenters. The
videos are well put together. The feedback and assistance you receive from the
discussion forums are better than I expected. This is the first time I’ve
taken a course delivered like this. The only negative for this course is the
delivery of the videos. At times the video server must be overwhelmed because
the browser would just pause for a long time waiting for the video. Closing
the video and reloading it usually worked. At times I would have to download
the video and watch it off line which was fine but a little annoying. Despite
this minor annoyance, as I said before high marks to this course and its
instructors.

programmer, but it is absolutely true that the course make you able to read a
quite advanced Python programming book, to make your first simple programs,

programs. Please attend this course, it will make you feel a better programmer

                    I had only a rudimentary introduction to Perl and Python before this class.
While the material is not always easy, and a lot of topics and functions have
been covered relatively fast, the exercises and mini-projects are built in a
way that even relative beginners like me can follow with some effort and
frustration (which I'm sure anyone with programming experience can attest to
is par for the course), given the amount of time to go over them. Although I
would have liked the course to be longer/moved a little slower, or maybe even
take this course a second time in order to solidify what I learned, the course
designers did an excellent job at introducing a good deal of python
programming practices, functions, and design tips. The video lectures are
rarely too long or dry, and the fun mini-projects (which are essentially
simple versions of games like Pong, Blackjack, Asteroids, etc.) give us
incentive to make things work so we can actually play the results of our
efforts. Bravo to the course designers!

Mechanical MOOC on Python via P2PU) and I loved getting the videos from
dedicated professors. I learned a lot just by hearing/watching and it made the
mini-projects a lot easier to do. CodeSkulptor, which was custom-built for
this class, is a wonderful utility (and it has a few student-built games that
just blow you away!) I didn't interact on the forums at all, but from what I

to beginners who want a moderate challenge in learning programming/Python.

                    Amazing class, I think it would benefit people who want to start programming
as well as people that already know to program but want to learn more about
Python or interactive programming. It was a fun class and I enjoyed doing the
assignments. I had programming experience in other languages but I enjoyed a
lot the methodology and I learned many things in this class that apply to
other programming languages.

                    I thought the only successful way to teach was to have a live instructor
teaching the class. In other words, I was anti-online classes. Well, this
class proved me wrong. I found myself feeling as if I was in a classroom and
completing the assignments so as to 'not let down my instructor'. Joe and
Scott are humorous and down to earth and at the same time 'got' their message
across and showed their skill and expertise. I learned much about interactive
programming in python and about making animated sprite sequences. For me I
cannot image taking this class without some previous python coding experience.
I found myself driven to complete the assignments and having fun doing it.
They gave lots of help to complete the assignments and the forums were a great
source of help. well worth the effort for what I learned -Dale

                    I never programmed in python but had a good programming experience in other
advance languages like Java and C++, VB and C sharp and much more. Having all
this experience beforehand, i never felt bored from this class and still think
that i have learnt alot more. I am also doing a Data Science course from
Coursera that is based on python. I would have otherwise struggled badly if it
wasnt for this course that was teaching me python's basic to advance concepts
like classes dictionaries. The tutors are excellent and have kept a light

                    I just finished taking this course in June 2013. It was my first GUI
programming course, not only in Python, but in any programming language. My
previous experience in C, Pascal, and Fortran had nothing to do with GUI
programming but they did help in understanding constructs such as 'if'
statements, loops, and functions. Some of the best topics I learned in this
class, however, include frames, timers, draw functions, sound, images, lists,
dictionaries, and object-oriented programming (OOP). I gained a firm
understanding of these topics through this course. I learned how powerful
these tools are and what I can do with them with regards to GUI programming.
Of the three MOOC classes I've taken so far, this course is without a doubt
the best and the most fun. I really enjoyed making games and the CodeSkulptor
application, the video lectures, and course exercises really localized the
material necessary to do so. I didn't have to go searching the Internet for
supportive material on topics I didn't understand. I look forward to applying
everything I've learned to making more games either in CodeSkulptor or some
other Python GUI application such as TkInter.....

                    I had one quarter of programming in college but was interested in python and
also in video games. The course was amazingly organized. It progressed very
naturally but also in a way that kept my interest the whole time. Because of
my previous experience the early weeks were simple but I was able to spend my
time by adding creatively to my projects. By the final weeks, the new material
was enough to keep me satisfied. Overall, it's a great introduction to python
and programming for games. You can really tell that the instructors put in a
lot of time and effort to make the experience a good one. I highly recommend
this course.

                    I am a biologist with a very small background in programing. My first contact
with object oriented programing was in this class and they really made
everything smooth. Great class, great teachers. Each week you are challenged
with a mini game project with the contents of the week's lectures. At first
you'll think you won't be able to handle it (I always did!) but then you'll
read the step by step instructions, look at the template they give you, you'll
visit discussion forums... and you'll ace it for sure. You always manage to
overcome yourself. That is an awesome feeling. I highly recommend this class.

                    I had some experience with python, especifically with web2py. This course is
really easy on the first time learners and have enough details for the
initiated. Python is the perfect language to learn the basics of programming
and then moving on the most complex things. This course excels at both of
those approaches. It shows the need of getting the basics right and then teach
to use them in real applications. Joe Warren and Scott Rixner (teachers) seems
to really love teaching and sharing their knowledge, wich they have by the ton
(look for their online resumees and see for yourself). The coolest scientists

                    Scott and Joe take a refreshingly fun approach to teaching coding. This is a
fairly lightweight course designed to teach Python fundamentals to anyone with
basic logic skills. The projects are very well planned and build on each
other. A framework is provided for each project along with a step by step
approach to complete it, and the grading is designed to ensure success.
Although I've been coding software for many years, this course was challenging
enough to keep me interested throughout. I actually learned a lot of Python,
and more importantly, now I really understand how event driven object oriented
programming works! If you're prepared to commit the time, do the practice
exercises, and sort through the noise on the forums, you will get something
out of this course, whether you are new to programming or an experienced
hacker. I feel the course truly delivers on it's title: I've been provided
with ""An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"", and I can build
on this with other courses and my own development projects. Thanks to all
involved in making this course possible, and making it available for FREE!

did minimal programming in Java. That was the only previous experience and
exposure I had to programming. This class did a really great job of
introducing the subject and making it interesting with immediate feedback. I
didn't think it was too hard but I did spend a lot of time on it. I really
liked everything about this class and the only way I can think to improve it
would be to make it even longer and cover even more material or maybe have a
second advanced course. I highly recommend it to anyone learning to program.

developing games was genius. This class was so much fun, I was sad when it

developed several programming classes myself and wish my quizzes would have
been have as good at validating the students understanding of the material as

quizzes you would probably learn more than you would in most introductory

                    This is an excellent course, but it will surely test your drive and mental
acumen. The weekly projects start off easily enough, but there's a high
difficulty spike around the mid-point, which can leave anyone but the most
hardened beginning programmers wondering if learning this new trade is worth
all of the anguish. Fortunately there is a highly active programming community
in the discussion forums, and most folks are very insightful. I heavily relied
on their abilities to make it through this class successfully. It's also
important to note the professors are very active in this community, and more
than willing to help a novice programmer who has lost his/her way. Take this
course if you're in the process of learning Python and have any interest in
videogames. It's wonderful.

course is well supported with video lectures, forum support, and code

programs, should the material / topic being covered seem fuzzy to you. All in

                    I had no previous experience with Python prior and very little coding
experience. This course shines. The instructors feel like family after 9
weeks. I wish them well. The curriculum was clear and organized. There is a
resource for all areas where you struggle. This class was actually very fun.
cant wait for more of this kind of connectedness in my courses online. Thanks
Joe and Scott (and supporting staff/professors from Rice).

                    I had a little bit of programming experience prior to this course in Visual
Basic for Applications (Excel programming). So I came to the course with a
basic understanding of some elements of programming (e.g. loops, variables),
but with no experience in others that were covered in this course (e.g. object
oriented programming, draw handlers, keyboard/mouse input). Compared to the
other MOOC courses I've taken (also Coursera - Gamification, Social Network
Analysis), this course was my favourite (although I enjoyed the others also).
It definitely has a heavier workload (mainly on coding using the web-based
""Code Skulptor"" tool that the profs developed and provide for use in the
course). Likes: \- Effective, engaging teachers who use the video tutorials
effectively \- Excellent web-based programming tool \- Very active discussion
boards and forums \- Good additional learning exercises \- Multiple levels of
support when coding including one-on-one feedback on your code, if needed, to
help it get working \- Good level of difficulty - definitely challenging but
doable. Note - some people felt that this course was too difficult for true
beginners with absolutely no programming experience. And many people found
that the workload was greater than indicated in the course outline. This
wasn't my experience, but learners should know going in that you do have to
put the work in to succeed at this course. Dislikes: \- Nothing major, but the
weekly quizzes sometimes seemed like they could have been omitted since so
much of the real focus was on the coding projects

                    With only a small (failing) background in programming, I tried this course as
a last-ditch effort to see if I could possibly get my head around
programming....it worked. I learnt so much, and in just 8 weeks I've signed up
to more programming courses as a result of the confidence and experience I've
gained here. The lecture videos are great. Entertaining (filled with 'dad
jokes' but that's just IT teachers I think!) and usually well paced. Having 3
different lecturers every week is quite useful as they do have different
teaching styles. The assessment is based on quizzes and peer-reviewed projects
each week. The quizzes are not really tests, a lot of the questions are more
like worksheets where you are given a new problem and asked to look up the
docs, write a small program and give the answer, etc. Actually a surprisingly
good way to learn, and the quizzes can be resubmitted so this works as a
learning tool. Peer reviewing made me the most nervous, but I was happy to not
have machine grading. My university courses were like that, and I think that's
why I failed. Slight variations are accounted for in peer review, and I have
to say I learnt the most when reviewing other people's broken code! Because I
am new to Python, I really wanted to figure out what was going wrong and help
the other students get to the answer, so I spent a lot of time reviewing. I
was able to do quite well on all the assignments, so I didn't really get much
feedback other than 'well done', but I do know from the forums that some
experienced students were taking the time to leave comments on how to improve
even if the grade was 100%. I've since started a couple of other online
courses, some on Coursera, and this one is by FAR the most organized. It's not
perfect of course, but the vast majority of material is proof-read, verified
and tested, and unfortunately this can't be said of other courses. I think the
key here is that the teachers really love teaching this course, and
programming in general. It comes across in their videos, in their presence on
the forums, and in the course itself. University or MOOC, this is the most
important and rarest thing to find. If you're interested in programming even a
little bit, I can't recommend this course enough.

you the opportunity to learn how to THINK how programming. It's is not only

career but wanted to learn Python and also fill gaps in my knowledge of
programing style and Object Oriented code. The class started off easy enough
but progressed at a quick pace to become challenging in the third of fourth
week. The weekly quizzes are interesting and are more like homework in the
sense many of the questions require research and programming in order to
respond. The Python environment ""CodeSkulpter"" makes experimenting easy by
eliminating the save/upload/try/repeat steps. The lectures are not dry as one
might expect in a programming course. The professors are having fun and their
enthusiasm is contagious, but they always remain quite professional. I'm very
happy I spent the time and effort to complete this course. I am now
""dangerous"" with Python, which was their stated goal. :-) Don H

                    Just completed this exhilarating, sometimes difficult, but alway interesting
course in Python. Although I hav some experience in scripting, mainly in Perl
and VB, I've always wanted to take that experience a bit further, and being a
games enthusiast, I've always wanted to know how games were written. So, 9
weeks ago I took the plunge. Quite honestly, it was one of the best things
I've done in recent year. Yes, it was difficult, and there were times when I
was about to give up, especially due to the amount of time the mini-projects
took (I'm a family man with a full time job in law enforcement). But I'm glad
I stuck it out until the end. The experience was very rewarding. So what were
the positives? The online environment including the Codeskulptor (where your
Python programs are written and executed in), the discussion forums, and the
way everything is integrated( I'm not sure if this is a coursera thing or it's
particular to this course/Rice Uni. The community of TAs that helped out if
you got stuck, were absolutely fantastic and gave you just the right amount of
help, without being condescending (especially Danilil Sokolov – he Rocked!) .
Other positives were the video lectures, that were done extremely
professionally, always humorous, never boring. Were there any negatives?
Perhaps one. I felt that doing a mini-project every week took a huge chunk of
time out of my schedule/family life, and I wasn't spending adequate time
learning some of the concepts thoroughly enough in order just to get the
project completed. Apart from that, it really is a great course.

experience with Python, and I found the course to be enjoyable. It is well
organized and structured. The quizzes and assignments doing a good job at

                    Rather than other courses focused on general programming, this course is aimed
to an specific goal; creating games. So the point is to teach programming and
as a project you create simple games. Instructors try make this course light
and fun and they really got it. Part of this course success are instructors. I
have some programming experience (variables, loops, if stamements but no
object oriented programming) and I found the course valuable, helpful and easy
enough for people with family and work like me. BUT I'm not sure how difficult
was for people with no programming experience. I could read on forums some
people managed, some others didn't. It really starts from the foundations but
at some point I guess some people can get lost.

                    This is a great class where you can just tell that the teachers are really
passionate about teaching and trying to help the students learn as much as
possible. I've taken a number of other MOOC courses up till now and this ranks
right up there as among the best of them. I really do appreciate the amount of
time and effort it takes to produce something like this, and the fact that
it's completely free makes it just that much better. If all university
lecturers were as passionate (and entertaining too!) about their jobs as these
guys were, there would probably be less dropouts and failure rates among
students. I take my hat off to Joe, Scott, John, and Stephen. Not that I
actually wear hats, but that's another matter entirely. Now about the course
material and content itself, I already was fairly familiar with Python and
also with Python GUI programming at my workplace, so it wasn't really
difficult for me. However, for a newcomer or beginning programmer, the content
moves fairly quickly from the very basics to object-oriented programming (OOP)
in six or seven weeks. I remember it took me a lot longer than that to grasp
OOP, and if there's a small critique that I could make, it's that there may
not be enough material here to sufficiently teach the beginning student
regarding OOP. Then again, this class isn't primarily about teaching Python in
the purest sense, but rather about teaching interactive applications using
Python (and CodeSkulptor) as a medium. There are plenty of material and
content out there on the Web that teaches Python, but as the subject of
programming can be seen as a rather dry subject, even informative and
comprehensive material could be ignored by many learners due to tedium or
boredom. I believe that the chosen subject of interactive programming here is
to pique and hold the student's interest, as well as display the possibilities
that could be achieved from the knowledge learned. And I haven't even begun to
expound on the entertaining antics that the professors indulge in in the
course videos - it's clear that they are having their share of the fun too in
the making of this course. When you can see that the teachers themselves are
having fun, as far as I am concerned, it just makes the learning process for
the students a whole lot more fun as well. In the end, I believe that that was
the aim of this course; to deliver a fun, memorable, and useful learning
experience for the student. Did they succeed? Well, I think my rating as well
as others' here says it all ;)

                    I was a intermediate user of python already as i joined this class, so the
programming content was pretty easy. With that said I would like to confess
that the class did strengthen a lot of fundamental concepts that I might had
skipped before or ignored to explore. The instructors were fantastic, and I
loved the way the concepts/content were wrapped around fun game assignments. I
had not done much of graphics programming before, and thus the philosophy of
the course/assignments were the best way to hone these techniques. I would
definitely recommend this course to everyone from no skills in programming to
relatively high skills in programming. This course has a something for
everyone. Even for the best programmers I would say the lesson is how to teach
your strength in a way that is enjoyable for all.

lot and enjoyed it immensely. I really hope these guys offer more courses.
Like a class on Java. Please???

                    This is a well-organized, introductory course on programming in Python. The
instructors did a great job with the video lectures, quizzes, and projects. It
should take 8-10 hours to complete the required work each week--a little less
at the beginning. There are a variety of games to be produced in this class,
including Memory, Blackjack, Pong, and the final project, Asteroids. If you
don't have any experience in this area or have trouble with logic and math,
you may find yourself trolling the forums (which are very helpful) for hours
and/or getting frustrated. I'm sure that many people quit taking the course
for one reason or another, but I'm so glad that I persevered and completed it!
Check it out! :)

                    This course was excellent! The teachers were really engaging, seemed to have
fun but also get through a lot of material. They also did a lot of prep work
in building tools that made the course workable so students could focus on
learning rather than messing around with getting software to work. The pace is
good, and there is room to do just the minimum, which is good for many, or go
a bit deeper when you felt comfortable. The assignments were fun (if you like
computer games) and the progression in complexity was well staged and very
rewarding. This is a great course for an introduction to programming and/or
python for anyone.

asteroid game in 8 weeks. The most unique part about the class is
codeskulptor. It's easy to use and doesn't require any downloads. The best
part about codeskulptor is the extensive well-classified docs that really
helped when I was working on the weekly assignment. Definitely one of the best
ways to start programming.

coding exposure at my job(s), it's amazing how much has changed. The cadre at
Rice who put this MOOC together deserve a large applause. Putting together the
programming environment (CodeSkulptor) and GUI module (Simplegui) made this
course successful. The video instruction was perfect for a MOOC. I can't think
of anything critical or negative to say. I will definitely take another
programming course from Rice. Keep up the good work guys, and thank you.

                    One of the best Coursera experiences I had up to now (we are talking about 10+
courses, if this can help) and surely the funniest. The teaching staff is
really great and gives us enjoyable, thorough and precise lessons about coding
with Python. It may seemed a bit rushed for a TOTAL beginner, but still doable
(in case you never coded, though, take my advice and do the excellent Python
track on Codecademy: you will get things done here in a much smoother way),
while even more advanced user will fine interest if not a big challenge in
programming their own version of some classic game (even two arcade cults from
the golden age!). The only down side? I think I'll miss it once that I have
completed and I hope we'll get another more advanced course from this awesome
staff soon :)

                    Before i had taken this course, all I knew about python was that it is a
programming language that's rather difficult and impractical but after
completing the course, now I am able to write somewhat sophisticated code
which is a great pleasure to me(no wonder why developers fall in love with
python). This course when compared with others is somewhat more user-friendly
because I went from generating programs with 1 line to a dozen hundred lines
of code, Of course occasionally there were a few difficulties but they were
gone in a matter of hours due to its helpful community and this was the first
coursera course that I had completely finished(from a whole of three) I guess
that was due to proper organization by the course staff The best thing that I
love about this class was its simpilicity, organization and support(both by
community and staff) for example once I got stuck with this mini-project
therefore I submitted it to the codeclinic(a place where you submit in case of
an fatal error) and guess what, I got a reply within 15 minutes and after an
hour I completed the project but the only complaint I can arguably think of is
that it could have stretched for a couple of more weeks so I can spend some
more time learning incredible things since I have enough time. Overall this
course was far by the most interesting, FUN, complete course ever. I thank the
course staff especially (Mr. Joe and Mr. Scott) I HIGHLY recommend this course
to everyone interested in programming!

                    I have only a basic level of programming (a few courses, almost 10 years ago).
Not having done other courses of this type I didn't know what to expect, but I
really enjoyed the class. I found peer review of other peoples code
particularly interesting and informative. The quizzes made sure I was on track
and the practice exercises were very useful, though I ran out of time to do
them as the course progressed (could only work on the course after hours). The
lectures were very well presented and the lecturers made the subject
interesting and presented at a level I could cope with. Overall, I really
enjoyed this course!

                    Excellent programming introduction to python. My first experience with
programming was in 1980 using Fortan WAT 5S so the object oriented world has
always been a challenge but the way classes and methods were introduced in the
lectures and then hands on practice in the mini-projects with the added bonus
of seeing how others in the class solved the same problems was one of the best
learning approaches I've seen. Great job.

                    I was a bit stuck with studying Python myself. What is out there is somewhat
confusing and lacks bottom-up approach overview. This course really solved
that for me. The course teachers are very enthusiastic and very motivating,
and the practical exercises are not only very instructive, but also fun to do.
There is even a great tool, called codesculptor, that allows you to play
around on your own in Python, without first having to read tons of manuals and
installing difficult things on our PC. I actually keep using that for small
experiments and tests while writing 'real' code. The course was fun all the
way, even through the more abstract concepts, and you get out with very good
foundations in Python, ready to fly on your own.

                    I enjoyed this course, and the benefit of having it come free of startup cost
was an added bonus. Having no background knowledge prior to enrolling, I
feellt I walked away with a wealth of data that could be utilized through
ongoing practice, usage, and exploration. I enjoyed the forum boards, I found
the people there were helpful and provide much need insight to debugging and
explain codes in another way. The online lecture videos were manageable for
time constraints and each professor articulate ideas with intellectual
charisma and foward-thinking structures, that made it easy to enter into new
concepts in a functional way. My only complaints if I have to give a contrast
is the limitations of the templates in breaking down more advanced concepts of
wiring up a programs parts which added to the time constraints for taking this
course. Also, it would be another bonus to have had more examples of games to
build, or a running user library for some of the more basic ways to setup and
shift Codeskulptur to the wide-group of developers and builders enrolled.
OVerall though, a great course. Much success with your future gentlemen and
thank you for giving time aside to develop this course project.

instructions like ""implement X in function Y to do Z"" are probably necessary,
but it would have been nice to have the general problem description and the
step-by-step breakdown separated in some way. The peer-grading and automated

take more advanced courses from this team!

                    While I had never used Python before, I have programmed professionally using
more than a dozen languages over 25 years. I enjoyed the class, and it quickly
brought me to a level where I can use Python on the job. In interactions with
other students on the class forums, I saw people with no previous programming
experience complete the class and learn Python effectively. They may have had
to struggle a little, and put in more time, but the support was there to let
them succeed. I have several college degrees and have completed over 100
courses for credit at 14 different colleges and universities. In addition, I
have taken professional development courses, used many courses from The
Teaching Company, and have probably completed over 100 free courses that do
not offer credit. With that background, I have to say that this was one of the
best courses of any type that I have taken. Joe Warren and Scott Rixner are
great teachers, and the Web based programming environment developed by Scott
for the course is an excellent learning environment and teaching tool. I would
strongly recommend this course for anyone who would like to learn to program
in Python. I also think it would be a great course for anyone who never
programmed before and wanted to see what programming was all about. Most high
school students with a strong interest in programming could complete the
course, yet it also has enough value to hold the interest of a person with a
Ph.D. in Computer Science.

                    No coding experience at all before this class, was asked to do this for work.
The course itself was very well presented, it was light-hearted and could be
done in your own time. If you had very little coding experience then it was
quite difficult but there was help within the forums etc. The teachers were
excellent and the course was well structured but the amount of workload was
quite a lot. Probably best to have had some coding before you start this class
or at least some other help outside of the course for some of the later mini-
projects.

                    I came to this class with no experience of Python and only basic theoretical
understanding of OOP, but I have completed the course to my great
satisfaction. My understanding of Python is still basic but I have every
confidence that I'll learn what else I need to use this in a more traditional
business setting. This course has been exemplary on a number of fronts: \- the
tutors' enthusiasm was infectious, and made the whole process of learning fun,
which is a fantastic achievement. \- the structure of the course (from the
video clips to assignments) plus of course CodeSkulptor, made it easy to get
involved and stay involved and inspired throughout. \- CodeSkulptor itself
deserves a special commendation: it took away one of the biggest problems that
I've come across with several other technical courses - getting the initial
install of the requisite software sorted out. Many of us are taking a course
like this do so in our spare time, and we do not have the time to figure out
some arcane install procedures, which open source software are particularly
prone to. I have highly recommended this course to several colleagues and
acquaintances, and am looking forward to what else Scott, Warren and John, and
the Rice university are going to offer in future. Well done all!

                    I previously had no experience with programming and took this course, as
stated in the title, as an introduction. I have to say, it has been fantastic.
It has not only introduced me to Python, but it has given me the bug and now i
want to learn more. I am not going to tell you as a beginner that it was easy.
It wasn't! But I have made it through to the end, and the tutors, community
TA's and other students, have been very supportive with learning just what you
need and more, to complete the course. The humour of the tutors in the
classes, creates a fun environment to learn. I really recommend this course.
Great job guys!!

Joe and Warren are great presenters. I learnt a great deal, the forums were
useful when I was stuck. At times I found the programming challenging and it
was often a relief to complete the assignments with all the rubrics ticked
off. This is my first coursera course that I have completed, although I have
passively taken part in a few. I liked the structure of the course and the
assignments were a joy to complete. It's a little sad to reach the end of the
class, although I now feel inspired to write games and even consider enrolling
on a more advanced class. Thanks again Thanks again for a great course!!

                    I've never did programming before. I even didn't plan to complete this course
at first. I signed just out curiosity. But I enjoyed,completed and recommended
it to my friends. and the reasons are: 1) the course is made very interesting:
every week you make a mini-project - game (not some boring stuff). you are
starting with printing out a phrase after the first week, and finishing with
making arcade game Asteroids after 8 weeks.And it is possible for people, who
didn't program before. 2) professors and students are very supportive. if you
stuck with your homework you always can ask for a help on forums. 3)
professors are very fun. so you not get bored watching videos. every week they
play a game that you have to write for your mini-project. 4) professors walk
you through all topics step by step. there is no such things in your homeworks
that they didn't mention in videos. they also review math and trig things that
you need for mini-projects.

                    This course was great! I haven't programmed in Python ever before and had a
very vague concept of OOP and GUI, but here I've learned how to make simple
aplications and I'm really happy know that I can do it. The video lectures
were always easy to understand and the miniprojects were challenging,
interesting and at the same time manageable with a little bit of patience. I
really liked it.

                    * I had zero experience with Python before, now can expand my knowledge of the language. * The course is just right for these who starting programming * I liked the CodeSkulptor - makes jumping into course much simpler. I disliked the fact there were no hard/soft deadlines for assignments, but this just from prior experience on other courses. Keep up the great work guys, and will be looking to participate in Advanced Python course! :)

                    Had gone through CBT nuggets, before this class was recommended. The step by
step approach, along with the weekly quizzes and projects really re-enforce
the material covered. Far better than the nuggets approach. Would recommend
for anybody with an interest in programming.

                    I am a beginner at programming and not a native english-speaker. The course
had a step-by-step teaching design that made it easy to follow, even without a
perfect deep understanding. Just do and see what happens. Additional material
was very helpful. Environment was great: no frustrating setup on my computer
was necessary, everthing ran out of the box. Assignments where challenging and
fun. I now have a basic knowlege of Python and some idea of algorithm in
general. Both will surely help me to find my way, how to go on learning
programming, even if it might not be Python. The staff obviously had fun
themselves. After the first two weeks it felt a bit like family. Thanks to
Scott, Joe and John, and all the others behind the scenes :-)))

                    This course starts from the very basics of python programming and ends up
giving you the tools to make a game type asteroids which is able to handle
collisions, play sounds, animate sprites, etc. In order to reach that goal
lists, sets, dictionaries, classes, functions, methods, variable types... are
all explained. They use codesculptor, which is a webbased gui of python. The
gaming features like drawing are easier to do here than in an ordinary gui for
python, but the transition to pygame or other libraries is not hard. I really
recommend you to take this course if you have no idea (or just the basics) of
python programming.

+ mother and still enjoyed the class and found enough time to do it. Great for
beginners, especially they they teach programming on a very practical language
instead of a student beginner language. Highly recommend for beginners.

                    I know basic programming, C, C++, Java. This course is awesome for several
reasons: 1\. The teachers are cool nerds :) they are a lot of fun and are very
clear and understandable. 2\. The course takes you to a place of real
programming, UI prigraming and games I really enjoyed the course and I can
surely say that this course is highly recommended. Good Luck!

professors are very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and the course itself is
organized to the details. Learning python this way becomes fun and you still
take away a lot of knowledge . Would like to see more of these guys in future.

gave all students a consistent GUI for given browsers. This is vital to the
course and its great strength. It also allowed you to show others (friends and

concepts and providing examples, and they inject enough humor and personality
into the lectures to keep it engaging. The mini-projects are well-designed and
while they seem daunting at first, the instructions help you think though the
problems and figure out what to do. I programmed a little bit of C++ a long
time ago but I found this course to be much more beginner-friendly and logical
in the way it presented each concept. I hope the instructors offer a more
advanced course.

explained all components very well. Couple of quizzes per week and a mini-

very simple to use and did not need setup. All in all a great class if you

                    No prior experience with Python. This course is awesome . Within a few weeks
I've been able to create games that I never thought I would be able to build.
The course is ""extremely"" well organized. The instructors have a wonderful
teaching style that keeps you interested and a lot of thought has been put
into the example exercises that the course requires you to complete. Thank You
Joe, Scott and team for coming up with this course.

expertise in other languages, but Python was a ne3w beast for me. And I loved
it! Its simple, free-flowing and elegant. And I believe the credit for this
love goes almost entirely to this course! The instructors were very friendly
and committed and mad learning fun. The materials were well thought of and
covered a wide variety of topics in a very intuitive and enjoyable manner. And

yourself....that's a great feeling! Try it out!

                    A very good class - they don't start with the usual ""hello world"" and then
loops, instead the focus is on building a game at the end, and you don't
realize that you learn a lot of things in the process. Especially those with a
little background in programming tend to avoid, say, to look at syntax of for
- assuming that it would work same as C/Java with some changes in
comma/parenthesis etc. Instead, this course has an aim mind, and with focus on
that, you learn (and practice too) everything else - automagically! Course-
instructors too are wonderful - chances are less that you feel bored, or fall
asleep.

                    Prior to this class, I had gone through the JavaScript intro material at
Codecademy.org. I found that to be helpful in approaching Python for the first
time. This course was not too challenging, but did require that I spend time
each week with the mini-projects, struggling through the instructions and
patiently building games step by step. The format, which taught me Python
through building simple games, was excellent, as were the professors. Thanks

                    I did take an introductory computer science class in college (20 years ago! In
Pascal!) but let me tell you -- this one was a million times more fun! For
one, this has got to be the most organised course I have ever taken. The
instructors are amazingly committed. And they are very clear, good teachers. I
am not a gamer, so I did not expect to really like the course -- I just wanted
to learn some Python. But I was surprised at how much fun I was having, and
how hooked I became. To be sure, there is a significant degree of hand-holding
in the projects ( so they felt a little too easy, most of the times), but
despite that, I enjoyed myself immensely, and I did find I learned a lot. And
I was actually sad the course was over. If these instructors ever organise
another course, I will take it in a heartbeat!

                    For one new to programming, this class was a challenge and a time commitment.
That said, every single moment spent was a pleasure! The class itself is set
up brilliantly... well paced yet accommodating to a wide range of students,
from beginners to those advanced in programming. Technically, it was
impeccable, without even the slightest glitch--coursework was completed and
submitted in CodeSkulptor which made peer assessments seamless, and videos
etc. were excellent in content and presentation. The course work was relevant
and the weekly projects were not only great fun, but utilized the skills
learned. The professors and those TA's, etc. who helped them out went above
and beyond what can even possibly be expected in a class of this size. Their
dedication and enthusiasm were impressive and contagious, fomenting a
""community"" of learners who reflected this. Between the forums and the direct
interactions via the ""code clinic"" no one was left stranded, and even a
beginner could actually reach the goal of completing the course. Take this

This one was just too good in all aspects, not too hard for an introduction
course but not too easy either, good ammount of work (extra practice
excersises for those who needed it). My only complain is that when the
teachers were playing the games to show us how they worked, I could not

                    I'm relatively new to python. My interest in it is more of a curiosity of how
things work than to use it for work or anything else. I took another class of
python which made me familiar wtih terms and such but I never really absorbed
it to where I was completely comfortable with it. However, this class'
professors are awesome and make you think you are having a good ol time while
feeding you tons and tons of excellent material. I can't believe how much I
have learned from this class. I didn't think it would be possible to learn as
much as I did in that short of a time. If you have any interest in taking
python, don't even hesitate to try this class. If you truly are a beginner and
are serious about coding and want to make it your career, I would really
consider putting more time than waht's suggested into it as you will get A LOT
MORE out of it. There is A LOT of practice material and A LOT of tools for you
to do this with. So much support in the forums. It's almost like having a
personal tutor. You have a question, well someone will answer it! It's an
incredible platform to learn python in. There was absolutely nothing I
disliked about this course. Lovely teachers and excellent content. I started a
tad late and it was a last minute decision. Coursera sent me an email of
classes I would be interested in and even though I'd seen it, I wasn't sure
about enrolling. I am more than glad I did join. The best class ever! Rice
does rock!! P.S. The astronaut visit in our last week's project... what a

                    I have done several online computer programming courses through Coursera, in
the last 6 months and this was by far the best. The presenters were
knowledgeable and fun, and the assignments were well thought out and FUN! The
workload was as advertised, not involving hours of extra work just to keep up.
In fact, I managed to implement the advanced techniques inside the allotted
time as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and am actually disappointed that
it's finished. I guess the big indication for me was that each week, I would
spend 5-6 days eagerly anticipating the next installment of lectures. I found
it to be in the medium difficulty range compared to the other courses,
although I had few problems due to the excellent teaching. I highly recommend

                    Great class. I've since taken other online classes and feel compelled to
mention that this class is quality-controlled in ways other online classes
aren't- the quizzes make sense, the practice exercises logically apply toward
the weekly projects, and the instructors bring a very human, almost tangible
quality to what one might otherwise consider just 'talking heads'. (The
dynamic between Joe and Scott, and to some extent even John- is key.
Rice/Coursera- look to these guys as models) The course workload for me went
longer than expected (12+ hours/week toward the end), but I suspect this was
mostly because I was doing assignments in the evenings (10pm - 2am) after an
already long day. For the novice student who is able to spend quality rested
hours at this- I think 8 to 11 hours should suffice.

                    An excellent introduction to the Python language. Eventhough I have a solid
background in programming languages, this course proved to be outstanding for
several reasons: First, instructors Scott Rixner and Joe Warren do an amazing
job in teaching the basics. They make concepts easy to follow and keep each
lesson strongly tied to how the course is developing. Second, the fact that
you get to program games makes it a lot more fun. For seasoned programmers,
the concepts needed to calculate things like collisions and keep game logic,
etc. are deffinitely worth and very well explained. Finally, besides the
burden needed to sort through a massive amount of posts, forums proved to be
an excellent way to get help and solve most of the problems that might be
keeping you stuck. Overall, I felt the format of the class was just right,
with lots to offer for those who want to learn Python programming and for
those just wanting to ""exercise"" a bit. I found mr. Scott Rixner to be an
excellent instructor.

thing I would have liked about the class is more coverage on Tkinter or
wxpython, bascially working on actual python.

outstanding. And I think it would be outstanding for those with little or no
programming experience as well as those who just want to pick up a new
programming language. Joe and Scott do an amazing job. The assignments all
build on each other, and you will be amazed how advanced your programming gets
by the end of class. The programming environment, CodeSculptor, is also an
incredible piece of work. Nice job Scott! Bottom line, if you'd like to learn
Python, take this class. You won't be sorry> I'm recommending it to anyone,
from those with little or no programming experience, to those who have a lot.

documentation was perfect for the class and available for use after which is
incredible. The best part for me, was learning object oriented programming
with games, I am not a big fan of games but it really helped me visualize
objects and methods. I am excited to try and use my new skills on big-data.

                    I wanted to learn Python as a replacement for PHP in server side code, but I
was also interested in game programming. Thanks to the amusing lectures and
the fun games I've learned the basics of the language and I am willing to move
beyond the course. I think that the course is suitable for people without
programming background as well as for experienced programmers. The lectures
are fantsatic and the documentation and links provided are very useful. The
code clinic and the forums were great and the TAs and even the teachers really
care about the student comments.

                    This is a well crafted and presented course. It would likely be challenging to
someone with no programming experience (but not beyond them if they have time
and commitment) but a lot of fun for someone who has some prior exposure to
programming. Much more fun and practical than some drier CS courses and you
are still learning good stuff.

                    ""Programming classes are so booooooring"", or so I thought. Not with this class
though. The lecturers are funny, informal, and you get to go right into
programming by making games, instead of going through old-school structured
programming classes. Definitely a recommendation from me if you want to dip
your toes into the waters of programming.

                    Previous experience with Python - nil. Loved the course content and the manner
in which it was conveyed. It moves quickly and I did not always finish the
projects on time but stuck it out to the end and recommend anyone who gets
lost to do the same because the more familiar you become with the style of
writing the easier it becomes. No matter what level we are at there is more to
learn. So if you have any doubts just do it anyway. Seriously, what is there
to lose.

interactive programming in particular. I liked the course, though I found it
maybe a little too elementary for me. This class is geared to the early or
beginning programmer. Projects specs are very detailed and essentially for any
experienced programmer they may amount to a little too much hand-holding.
However, the teachers are great, very amusing in an supernerd kind of way that
verges on dorkiness. They are fun to watch and I would definitely recommend
them. They bring personality to the subject and the huge number of boring cs
teachers out there might do well to emulate them. Check 'em out.

many years. I had an interest in Python and had done some minor Python
programming in the past. I found the course valuable for multiple reasons: 1)
The course runs on a schedule. I was forced to find time to do the work. I
learned more in a few weeks than I did in years of having a Python book sit on
my shelf 2) The projects were interesting and fun 3) Great video lectures from
some great professors 4) Very active discussion groups 5) Code Skulptor
provides a very nice programming environment for doing projects and trying
things out. The accompanying documentation was a huge help I would recommend
the course to anyone who is interested in Python. Thanks much to Coursera and
the professors for creating it.

                    I've always been interested in programming but have never done it before. This
was a great course for a beginner like me. I'm not mathematically inclined and
I really liked that math wasn't a big focus on this course. The fact that each
week focuses on creating a game really helped to keep me motivated and
displayed interesting and practical ways of utlising the techniques that I was
learning about. This course has helped me understand what programming actually
is, how it works, and taught me the basics of the Python programming language.
Would recommend for any newbies wanting a taste in programming - or maybe
someone after a refresher course.

                    I've taken many online programming courses, but this one was by far the best.
It starts at week 0 with the basics of programming, and takes you step by step
until you are able to make fully-fledged, functional games that also happen to
be fun. That was the part I liked the most about this course; by teaching
fundamental programming concepts through making games, you learn the material
without ever feeling burdened, and come out of the class earning a great sense
of accomplishment.

MOOC that I have completed. I've taken many in the past but I never went
further then dabbling. This course changed that. I've always wanted to learn
to program and Joe, Scott and the others have created something that pulls you
in, keeps you focused and makes you care. Their goal is to make you
""dangerous"". After 9 weeks of programming one mini game a week I now feel
dangerous. My goal was to open up possibilities in other courses that require
programming to get the most out of them. I now feel ready to take on any of
those. I am now hooked on both programming and MOOCS. Thank you!

                    In a nutshell, this is an AWESOME class. This was my first Coursera course
(and i opted for the signature track because i wanted to bring in some sort of
self discipline w.r.t completing the class) and i must say i completely
enjoyed it. The course content, the format, student discussion forums,
practice exercices which can help build up the concept - all of these were top
notch. As for me, i wasn't a newbie when it came to Python.. i had used it in
the past (but only for some console driven stuff) and wanted to learn about
the game development capabilities of Python. What this course helped me was
get an insight into how a game is built, what are the key concepts. Doing this
course also helped me revisit my cartesian geometry and elementary physics,
which i completely enjoyed as well. I am now looking forward to more coursers
from the professors. They are one of the best faculty i have got coached from
so far in my life.

                    An excellent course if you are interested in programming but you don't really
know how to get started. Python has a very nice Syntax that is easy to learn
and thus perfect for beginners. The instructors, Joe, Scott and Stephen are a
blast, they invested a lot of their time to make this course a valuable and
rich experience. From the very beginning you have to write code, in 5-6 short
videos they explain and demonstrate the topics that you need for the week's
mini project, and then you have to build that yourself. The templates and the
Step-by-Step explanations are invaluable in my opinion. Building up knowledge
from the first week, you use it all together in the last project, where we had
to code Asteroids. Many of the students went with extra and bonus stuff. To
me, it seemed like everybody wanted to show off what they learned. So if you
are interested in programming, already did some program in school or just want
to learn python, then take this class, I highly recommend it

                    I have programmed in Pascal before and haven't for over ten years and wanted
to relearn programming with OOP. I can honestly say this was the most fun I've
had watching lectures and coding, there are awesome discussions, ideas, help.
It beats sitting by yourself and going through it alone. I liked it so much
that I paid to be a signature track! Their online python CodeSkulptor is
amazing and allows you to make real GUI games! I built a meteor blasting game
where I zoom around in a spaceship with sound effect and explosions - and it
took me only a few hours to code! These guys are just plain good teachers.
'Nuff said. I'd recommend this for anyone wanting starting out or learning

                    I can't give enough praise for this course and its instructors. Though I've
had a background in computers, I had never been behind the scenes with
programming. Rice University's class on Coursera took me from zero knowledge
of programming to the skill it takes to code a game of Asteroids in only few
short weeks (though, I was completely confused with the idea of 'iteration'
when it was first introduced). There's a great community within the class,
both among students and with the TAs and instructors. I always found the
answers to my questions (usually concerning my faulty logic within my mini-
projects), and nearly all interactions were positive. One downside for me was
the workload. The workload was excellent at the beginning of the course. I
kept up very well for the first 5 weeks or so. Then it started getting more in
depth, and I had to spend many more hours on the class than I had originally
planned. While I still enjoyed the class and was able to finish all of my
projects, I didn't have time to explore (and experiment with) some of the
concepts as well as I would have like to. This class is a great way for
novices to learn Python.

                    My only experience with programming was FORTRAN course in my graduation (more
than thirty years ago). This course is fun and you can learn a lot. I
absolutely recommend it. Everything (videos, examples, mini-projects) is
really good and, if you work hard enough, in 8 weeks you can learn a lot (and,
better, have fun). I'm an engineer and didn't have time to look at the forums
frequently, but it seems that it's a good way to improve your learning. I'm
glad to have done this course and I'm sure that it gave me the background to
go ahead in Python programming.

                    I am an experienced programmer, but was new to Python. The course did a great
job of getting me productive with Python quickly. The course tools gave me
everything I needed to start using Python immediately, without lots of
research/decisions and without a steep learning curve. This allowed me to
focus on the language itself. All of the instructors did a great job and there
was also a lot of help and interesting discussion in the forums as well. I
would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Python quickly,
or looking to learn programming in general.

any kind of coding. This class very refreshing and i loved the spirit of all
the professors. It was so contagious. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and
looking forward to more courses. I also feel that I have learned a lot in the

adding to this class is give a small talk about how Python is used in the real
world. What type of jobs uses Python extensively will be great value addition

My goal is to learn Python as quick and as thoroughly as I can and this class
allowed me to do just that. Gradually we've covered most of the topics in
Python from simple print method to using advanced data structures, to using
classes, to event-driven programming. Moreover, everything was done by coding
games which made the course much more fun. My games were tested by my son and
he really enjoyed this too so I hope he may start learning programming when
the time comes. So, thanks to Joe Warren, Scott Rixner and their crew for
helping to create such a nice learning experience. I highly, highly recommend
this class to everybody who wants to learn Python and get introduction into
game programming.

Programming in Python is definitely the class for you! Joe and Scott worked
hard to make this an enjoyable experience. The learning was fast paced but

The videos were informative and leading as to how to accomplish the tasks

what made it interesting. For the cost of free, how can you pass up this well
thought out and planned program to get you up and running in python. I'm

                    In the beginning when they showed what the final assignment would look like I
was sceptical that I'd be able to learn to do so much in such a short time. I
turned out to be wrong about that. Every week builds on the previous week and
you learn all that you need to know. I've done some programming before and
I've never had as much fun learning a new language as I've had while doing
this course. The peer grading works well for me. The grading rubric laid out
what needed to be there in order to get the points. There is a lot of
flexibility to be creative in what you do which really isn't there in a
machine graded course. I liked being able to add my own personal touches in
the assignments without being penalised because the machine grading system
doesn't allow such things. I learned more about Python and some basic OOP
ideas than I'd have been able to learn on my own. I'd really recommend this
course.

                    I started out by getting down the fundamentals of Python using Codecademy.
While I was nearing the end of the tutorials on Codecademy, I came across this
class on Coursera, and although the Coursera course does not require any prior
programming experience, it was a very seamless transition for me since I had
the basic syntax down. The lectures were very well thought out and
entertaining even. Good content with not too much fluff. The quizzes were very
fair and the mini-projects were incredibly fun. We built interactive games
including Pong, Memory, Blackjack, and Asteroids. Building games allowed me to
learn programming in a really fun way. As part of the class, you also grade
other students' mini-projects so you can really get some interesting ideas
seeing how other people decided to implement their projects. I think the best
part of the course is a website called Codeskultor which was built by one of
the professors. It's a really really easy way to hit the ground running to
learn Python. You don't need to worry about the hassle of installing things.
You just navigate to the website within your browser (no IE support, sorry),
code in the browser, and run in the browser. It's truly seamless, easy, and
fun. Thank you Scott, Joe, John, and Stephen! I had a blast!!

                    To think that I wrote my first code (""Hello, world!"") in the very first week
of this course and finished the course eight weeks later, writing the bulk of
a modern-looking Asteroids is almost scary to think about... The course is
accessible to anyone with the patience for learning. Week-by-week, the
difficulty increases slightly, so as not to push you into the wild and away
from the course and to keep you interested. From the very small definition, to
writing a long and difficult class, the intermediate steps make the transition
from non-programmer to a programmer very manageable. I know from my friend's
experience and from reading the forums, that some may struggle to completely
finish the course. The later stages may seem daunting. However, it's worth
pointing out that the access to knowledge comes fast and rewarding. For
example, after just three or four weeks of the course, I started thinking
about the world in terms of programs, such as how sports matches may keep
track of the score by a very simple program! It is a credit to the hard work
that the lecturers have put into the course that makes it such a wonder to
learn from. Having finished a degree at university, and learnt from more than
20 lecturers over the course of it, few of them match the instructors of this
course for enthusiasm and effort.

                    Going into this class, I had no experience with python. I did have some
experience in VBA, .NET, and C++, and Java. I can honestly say that even if I
had never programmed before in my life, with the guidance that this course
provides, I could have made it just fine. Python is a fantastic programming
language and the way that Joe and Scott present the topics is logic, well
organized, and easy to understand. If you are new to programming and want to
really dip your feet into this area, I would highly recommend this course!

are fun and there is enough guidance to keep us on track. CodeSkulptor is a

able to code using my ChromeBook. I hope they keep CodeSkulptor alive, even

                    I've begun a couple of MOOC courses over the past two years, but this is the
first course I've stuck with to the end. I did some elementary programming in
BASIC and Pascal back in the '80s, so many of the concepts presented in this
course (conditional statements, loops) came easy to me. I also had prior
experience with calling functions, but I knew nothing about Objected Oriented
programming before taking this class. Bottom Line: I felt this class
successfully found the middle ground between easy and hard, between hand-
holding and throwing the student to the wolves. At times I felt the
instructors gave us a bit too much help with their mini-project templates
(especially with the Rice Rocks game), but then I realized I was still
learning the desired concepts while getting to program (and play) some pretty
neat games! I devoted quite a bit of time each week to my mini-projects,
losing a few hours of sleep here and there in order to meet my deadline. The
quizzes were also surprisingly challenging, but rewarding, too. The
instructors clown around a little in the lecture videos, which at first I
found mildly amusing but contrived. However, over time I realized that the
clowning around had made me, the anonymous online viewer, feel like I was
getting to know the professors personally, as if I had been sitting in a small
university class for the semester. This is a pretty neat trick. In summary,
this class was informative and fun, and I feel I now have enough knowledge of
Python and OO programming to tackle complex programming projects on my own.

you could do with python. I liked this course a lot. Warren, Rixner, Greiner
and Wong are really good professors and I hope they continue making this
course for a really long time. I also have a idea that maybe they could teach
more programming languages like Java Script or HTML 5. This would encourage us
also to look for more programming languages and become even more ""dangerous""
and also guiding us to programming success.

                    The web-based CodeSkulptor tool really focuses the video content by providing
a consistent programming environment which works well for all students. It's
also a great intro to the Python language and covers a lot of ground.
Personally, I found it on the easy side, but I'm familiar with other
programming languages. I think a complete newcomer to programming would find
it accessible with the help of the practice questions and the discussion
forums. Would definitely take a follow-up course if offered.

                    Started out with no knowledge of Python, and a beginner programmer in general.
Now I love Python, I'm hooked, I'm shifting into making some of my own games
for fun. The class was entertaining, and so well structured and supportive
that you really want to finish it and feel that you can. Loved the course,
teachers are lovely, the amount of help given to us was perfect. I learned so
much, thanks!

                    Great course and I strongly recommend this as a excellent way to begin
programming in general - not just Python/Interactive programming. The
instructors are passionate and knowledgeable. There is an amazing amount of
support from both the instructors and technical assistance in addition to your
peers. At no point will you feel alone in this course. Note: I spent a lot
more time than the suggested weekly workload although was more to do having to
brush up on maths than the actual programming tasks. I would suggest if you
are rusty with topics like Algebra, Trigonometry, Physics (basic), Cartesian
Coordinates and modular arithmetic then you might want to take courses on
those subjects beforehand.

                    I had a great time in this class and learned a lot. I can't complement this
class and the instructors enough. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I had learned basics of
python prior to taking this class - mainly from codecademy's python exercises
and I'd worked on a few of my own projects. I found this class excellent for
conveying the ""how"" and ""more proper"" structures and ideas of how to put code
to use to build games in a usable way. Previously I was hacking stuff together
that would run and could do some interesting things - but it was a mess of
code. This class in particular helped me understand object oriented
programming and proper use of classes. One caveat: If you're new to
programming make sure you are self-motivated as the difficulty can ramp up
quickly. I found the blackjack project very challenging - that was the first
project where we were exposed to object oriented programming and it was a bear
to understand imho. Also: while many in the class were able to get by in maybe
3-6 hrs of programming on weekly mini-projects - I was not one of those. I
easily spent 10+hrs on most weeks and 20-40hrs on the later projects -
although some of that time was me polishing up and adding onto the programs. I
actually wish the class went on for several more weeks with some additional
projects because I found the structure and developmental processes utilized
beneficial in clarifying my thinking about how to code. Seeing the process of
how to think about the code makes a difference. I'm going to go on and do some
of my own projects with python and probably pygame now - but I gotta admit I
think I'll miss simplegui that is used in the class quite a bit.

very good point is the accesible English level during the whole class. I say
that because I'm a Brazillian Portuguese speaker which hasn't done the English
course yet, but that was able to understand everything and finish the class
with no problems about language. This class is very fun and teaches a lot
about how to program in Python, with the differential of the CodeSkulptor, a
platform web that allows to program and save all the codes in the cloud. Take
this tool and the great teachers and you'll have a nice experience with
programming in Python (making games!!!). Enroll it and you can hope a very

                    It is a very helpful course. I actually tried to start programming (in other
languages) a few times but never really got to a point where I could build
more interesting stuff than purely text-based software. After those last 8
weeks I am now able to build some nice games and motivated to go on. The
contents are presented in a way that is easy to understand and the progression
is very fit for people who got other things to do during their week as well.
The tempo might be a bit slow for you, if your willing and able to start
programming 7 days a week, but even then the first weeks might help you a lot.
Wouldn't want to have missed it.

                    This online class was phenomenal! I went from having very limited knowledge of
coding to making some shockingly complex programs. It seems like I spent more
hours a week on it than advertised, but this is mostly a function of my
perfectionistic nature. The course was very orderly and had helpful templates
for all the course projects. The class discussion forums were also of great
assistance in solving coding problems as they came up.

                    I had very limited programming experience prior to taking this course (I took
an Intro to Computer Programming course using Pascal and took a class that had
a little bit of programming in C, both about 12 years ago). This course was
very accessible to me as a beginner programmer, and I learned a tremendous
amount. Not only did I learn a lot , but I also had a lot of fun. I think that
because the projects for this course are interactive games, that makes it
instantly engaging and gratifying. I loved the fact that I could learn
programming through my web browser right away, and that I can easily share my
creations with others. The video lectures were engaging and easy to follow.
There was plenty of learning support provided. I am completely satisfied with
this course, and I really enjoyed taking it.

                    I always wanted to learn python, but never got around to any of the ""self-
study"" tutorials --- I'm just not good a doing these types of things without
structure and some kind of timeline. This class provided just what I needed:
weekly instruction with video lectures, weekly quizzes, and a weekly mini-
project (with due dates!) This helped me continue the momentum of learning.
The professors are really good, easy to understand, and keep the class very
entertaining. If my CS professors in college were like these guys, I would
have chosen to follow a CS career! The forums can be helpful, too, if you are
stuck. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn python. You do not
really need to have previous programming knowledge. You won't end the class
being able to get a full time job programming in python, but it will
definitely give you all you need to know to see if Python is for you.

                    I am currently going to college for a computer science major, but I was
getting dissatisfied with the lack of practical, applicable things I was
learning. This course started when I was still in school, and I was easily
able to balance school work, including finals, and this class. The class is
fun and even I learned a lot from it. You are doing pretty cool projects by
the third week and the teachers made it all very understandable and fun.

                    I loved lectures of Scott very much. Sometimes I had problems with
understanding the words of Warren because he speaks too fast for me. I am not
native English so it can be my fault. Some parts about programming techniques
were too boring for me but they can be useful for novice programmers. An
important problem was that the staff introduced an ugly programming
techniques. This made python a bit unpleasant for me. Contrary to the clues
mentioned in the last video, I would introduce the global GameState class,
just after the introduction of classes. In a nutshell, apart from small spots,
this was a very nice course and I would suggest it to everybody who wants to
participate a happy introductory-like course. Thank You, guys. :) Csongor

                    As a long time, old school programmer with little experience of GUI, event-
driven or game programming I had been wanting to learn Python for a long time.
This course was just what I was looking for as it was both fun and
educational. The lecturers from Rice really knew their stuff and provided a
structured way to learn a surprising amount in just eight weeks. It is obvious
that they enjoyed teaching the class and that makes a huge difference when you
are faced with an online learning experience. I am pleased to have completed
the class (and to get my Saturdays back!) but I will miss Scott and Joe's
video lectures and will almost certainly look for some more of their classes
in the future.

                    This is truly fun class. The mini-project are assignment which re-enforces
some of the lecture materials in the class. I always go back to view the
related lectures again and again whenever I stuck in the progress of the mini-
project. This class brings in some fun in comparison to other class which more
emphasis on the features of the programming language python itself. I
registered this class about a week later because I was not planning to
register this class at all. However, right at the end of the other Python
class ""Crafting solid code"" also available on Coursera, one of the students in
that class recommended this one. So, I registered this class wanting to find
out what is the main difference between the two. I like the game assignment of
the class. It takes the dryness of the learning of a programming language
away. What I don't like is there it doesn't seem there are answer keys for the
quizzes. I did not do really well in the quizzes for the class and a lot of
time I'm not sure why I got the wrong answers either. Overall, it's a great
class even for those like me just having completed another instroduction
python class before this one. I tip my hat to all the professors to come with
this exceptional interesting introduction to python programming class. I truly
hope this is a sequel about this class which will emphasize on how to design
class to avoid lot of use global variable and the unit test of python code.
Thank you you all for your tremendous time put into this course. Great work
and great class!

                    I have a master in computer science from 1977 (back with hand crank computers)
and I stopped programming and went into other areas. So Python seemed like a
good place to start and this course seemed to offer a good intro with a fun
product. It nailed all my expectations. It was challenging, but rewarding. The
support level through the discussion groups, T/A's and teachers got me through
a few tough spots. And it was fun. I was disappointed when we got to the final
assignment (Asteroids!). I wish there was a second course of this to extend my
knowledge.

                    I just finished this course and really enjoyed it ! The instructors are funny,
and keep the online videos to be entertaining and informative. I enjoyed
working on all of the mini-projects and only really struggled with the second
last mini-project but eventually figured it out. There are practice exercises
and a forum which really help. I hope to see Joe Warren and Scott Rixner teach
in more online courses in the future!

                    This was a great course. It was extremely well-organized and was able to take
beginners through the process of learning a new programming language in a way
that was effective and fun. I have taken one previous introductory programming
course, which helped me in the start of the course, but I believe that any
beginner programmer with a few hours a week to put into the mini projects and
lectures should find this course enjoyable and informative.

                    Amazingly well designed. With some extremely dated programming experience, I
was able to finish up each week's videos, quizzes, and project in about 4
hours. I always spent a bit more time on it, though, because I got really into
the projects and wanted to add more to them. I would recommend this class to
anyone, and you could take it as a complete programming novice.

                    This has been my first online course and I attended it as a complete newbie
(with no programming experience). What can I say? Most importantly: I made it.
And there were specific moments you have to fight with yourself in
programming. I have seen people giving up, but I think it's finally a question
of will. I can highly recommend this course for everyone interested in arcade
games and programming or just how this stuff works behind the curtain. The
course structure is very cleverly laid out and the practical examples shift
good into lectures. We even learned quite a bit about OOP, which was the
moment I really found pleasure in it. I was surprised about the effectiveness
of online learning, it's way more effective than a real life lecture, because
of a slight difference: The rewind button. Don't underestimate the time it
takes though, it's a tough course, if you are new to programming and chances
are good that you will need above 9 hours a week are likely, especially in the
weeks you build Memory, Blackjack and Asteroids. Joe and Scott are among the
best lecturers I've ever have experienced and there are a quite a few (John
helps a lot on debugging and write less and cleaner code) and there is a
certain element of humor in this course, which creates a very familiar
athmosphere. There are a bunch of helpfuls and supportive guys in the forum as
well, that know their stuff and help you, if you are stuck. I will miss all of
you guys. A big thank you to the computer science departement of Rice! Very
Nice! Yannick

have a degree in computer science, I had never programmed in Python. I
currently teach computer science at the high school level and I really
appreciated the way the instructors approached the content and presented the
material. I also loved the idea of peer evaluation and the structure of those
evaluations. I plan to incorporate a similar idea in my own classes. This
class was available for a wide range of students and addressed the needs of
all levels.

                    Just sign up for it !! It's not easy, but what that's worthwhile is ? There's
nothing more satisfying than 'getting it' and this course delivers if you are
prepared to commit the effort. That's one of the BEST feelings you can have.
Some on the April 2013 run were back for a 2nd time - so if you don't get it
this time, then you will if you work at it. I'd programmed before in 'linear'
fashion (even abusing OOP languages) but never ever 'got it' for OOP - until
just recently via this course. Great lectures - fun and engaging, challenging
exercises and stretching quizzes combined with excellent support makes for a
'must have' experience. Just wish they had a 'follow-on' course...

                    This is an excellent class for absolute beginners. I did not have any prior
programming experience and was a little worried initially if I would be able
to handle the class. But the class was amazing! It was very well organized and
build up progressively with lots of practice exercises. Especially helpful was
an amazing in-browser ""thing"" called CodeSkulptor that let you start to
program right away without having to download and fiddle with installing
several programs. The professors were enthusiastic, sometimes funny and always
very clear about the topic they were teaching. You could feel that they truly
enjoyed teaching and really wanted you to succeed. The TAs and the forums were
great help when stuck during the homework assignments. I can recommend this
class to everyone who wants to start learning to program in Python. Do not
hesitate because you have never done any programming! You can learn it with
this class! And you probably will get hooked on it like I did!

as well. I was afraid to be a good programmer but after this class I learned
very strong fundamentals of programming and now I feel more confident about my
programming. I can see improvement in my work as well.

                    This was a pretty great course. I had just a little bit of experience with
Python before I took this course, but I was eager to learn how to write
interactive programs, which I hadn't done in my previous work with Python. The
interactive nature of the programs we wrote made this course much more
engaging and fun than other Python courses I've seen, and I felt it moved at a
reasonable pace for people with limited programming experience. I learned a
lot from the course and actually had a lot of fun doing it. The only downside
is that all of the programs are written in Codeskulptor, so it will take a
little bit of getting used to writing directly in Python. But the instructors
assured us that that shouldn't be too difficult.

                    I am 27 year old architect with no prior experience with coding, even most of
my math skills from college were wiped out. This class took me from zero to
completing a +600 lines of code project introducing the concepts of event
driven programming, object oriented programming and much more in a very well
structured class and a very appealing theme of game-project based exercises.
The only drawback for me is the excessive amount of time this course consumed
weekly which was well beyond 12 hours, sometimes reaching a whooping 24 hours.
Other than that, it was perfect and the community in the forums is very
helpful.

                    I liked the challenge of a new project every week. The first week's project
wasn't much more than a series of conditional statements, and the final
project was a very realistic asteroids game. I liked that I spent most of my
time writing programs, not watching lectures. The lectures gave you what you
needed to know, but only took about an hour a week. The quizzes were short,
but usually had at least one or two challenging questions, often requiring you
to write a short program to find the answer. Questions in the forums were
usually answered by other students within 10 minutes of being posted. The web-
based Python development environment, CodeSkulptor, allows students to write
their programs on the left side of the screen and see console output on the
right side of the screen. Graphical output is in a pop-up window. It's hard to
think of anything bad about the course. I'm glad I came with some programming
background. The CodeSkulptor web-based IDE made it easy to submit programming
projects (by exchanging URLs), but it's not the way real Python programmers
work. It's a trade-off, probably a good one, but I still can't write a stand-
alone GUI program now. I taught myself programming when I was in middle school
and high school in the 80's (mostly BASIC). Although I think I got pretty good
on my own back then, I haven't done much with it or progressed until I took
this class. Before this class, object oriented programming was a mystery and I
had never heard of event oriented programming. I would strongly recommend this
course to anyone who has at least a little background programming in any
language. For those with absolutely no programming experience, I would work at
least half-way through a beginner Python programming book first, just so you
won't be hearing things for the first time in the course lectures.

                    I think this was a really well run course that covered a lot of ground. I had
been learning, on a very basic level, different programming languages but this
one really got me to understand object oriented programming more than any I
had tried before. In fact it is the first course that compelled me to finish
it. The level and the pace was just right. It was hard a times and took a lot
of work to figure out some of the problems but when I finished them I felt
really great knowing that I had been challenged!

and catched up 3 weeks of material. After that I was on schedule every week,
and totaly loving it. Having the week's videos on saturday was a happy moment
every time. Great teachers, and the tools also very useful. I think what's
best is the use they made of the tools they had as teachers. It shows they are
in love not only with programming but also teaching. I sincerly thank you
everyone that worked on the course. I hope you keep it online. Imagine any
curious kid in the world could take this course and turn himself into a

                    I entered this course without any experience in Python, but a fairly extensive
knowledge of other OO programs like Java and C++. I really enjoyed the setting
of this course and the instructors. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount
of information that I gained from this course. Not only did I learn the basics
of the python language, but there were some really good information on GUI and
game theory that I had never been exposed to before. Overall, I would highly
recommend this class to someone that is just starting out in programming
and/or has an interest in getting in to the video game hobby.

had NO background), but there's a fair bit of hand-holding through practice
exercises, forum discussions, community and TA project help, etc. that helped
me through it. I learned a great deal, including from others working through
the projects and assignments with me, and found the class a lot of fun. The
instructors are phenomenal, and the construct of the class was well organized,

                    I started really focusing on learning programming again after a break of about
15-years. Since January I have studied Javascript, JQuery, Python, Ruby,
HTML5, and CSS. I was drawn to the Introduction to Interactive Programming in
Python course because I wanted to break free of command line programming in
Python. The course is an excellent tool for learning Python and basic GUI
programming. I can honestly say I am going to miss the challenge of creating a
new project on a weekly basis. If you are interested in programming, you don't
want to miss this course.

                    I programmed in Uni years back and had not programmed anything real since.
Python was a way to get into a modern language and go back to algorithms, OO
and making stuff. That said this course started as basic as it could get and
evolved to something that would take most of my saturday to crack. It was
extremely good and I now feel comfortable with the language. I wish the
workload was not so big, but I guess this is not designed for full time
workers, but for students.

                    This has been my fourth MOOC, all on Coursera. It has been the one that was
the most fun. I am a professional software programmer, but I've never used
Python, nor have I seen it. This course was an excellent introduction - much
more entertaining than a book. I also like the communal learning experience by
going through the course with others. Using simple games for the programming
paradigm was inspired. In most cases, students were already familiar with the
game, and it was fun to see it work. I would definitely recommend this course
to others.

                    The class is very well organized, the instructors are really good at teaching
and and the content is absolutely relevant. If you don't have any experience
programming the course might get a little bit difficult on the second half,
but the teachers will help a lot. 100% recommended

                    I had years ago some programing experience with other languages (Pascal,
Basic, some assembler and VBA). I'm now looking for a programming language for
data analysis and saw numpy, pandas and other libraries so become interested
in learning some more about Python to be able to progress in that direction.
This class is a very good starting poinbt and informative about python and I
think that I now have what needs to progress. Gaming was a good method to make
this course fun and interesting even if my main goal stay with data analysis
more than gaming. Very very nice job, I really appreciated it.

                    This course was probably the best programming class I've taken! They need
courses like this in my school's computer science program, and they need
professors like these four in my school's computer science department!
(Although, I would go one further and say they should come teach at my
university themselves!) This class was the most interesting and funnest
programming course I've taken. It was also the easiest to understand and grasp
the concepts of. The workload is just right, not too heavy, not too light. The
quizzes and mini-projects are set-up to internalize and review the material in
a way everyone can do well at doing if they put in the effort. You are being
challenged, but you NEVER EVER feel like you're being ""weeded out"" in this
class. No matter what skill level you are at, you will get something out of
this class. For me, I've been doing this for a while now, and I've improved my
understanding of object-oriented programming, event-driven programming and
game programming, and feel I could be quite successful doing that for a career
in the future. Everyone who's serious about learning programming should take
this class!

                    Great introduction course for people just starting out in programming. If
you're a complete beginner then when the GUI concepts are introduced it might
seem a little steep to follow, but if you stick around everything starts
falling into place and as the weeks pass you really start getting a good grasp
of it. The same thing happens when classes are introduced, but again sticking
around slowly makes you understand the whole design and process of modularity
and object oriented programming. Overall a great course and a great stepping
stone for more advanced classes. Had a great time taking it. One piece of
advice: If you can get someone else as well to take the class with you, then
discussing the approach for solving the problems really helps.

                    Awesome introduction course. I went from beginner to dangerous in 8 weeks. I
really liked the format; videos stayed on point covering 1 topic usually
pretty quick (<15 min.), two quizzes a week with some questions which were
actually pretty difficult requiring some thought and understanding and/or
using codeskulptor to get the answer, and 1 mini-project a week too test your
programming skills. Hopefully, they don't change a thing. The only problem is
now I want an intermediate course from these guys.

to start programming your own games within their own programming tool, so you
don't need to be installing anything and let you work anywhere as it's embeded

knowledge (just the basics of what variable/iteration/function means) and i
had no problem completing this course. The Scott - Warren duo is really what
makes up this course. They are both very good and enjoyable instructors. The
best part of this course are the mini projects. There is no more rewarding
experience than building a game and find out that it actually works. I am a

                    In the last year I've taken two MITx/Edx classes, several Coursera classes,
two Udacity classes, Chuck Severance's Python course and a couple others. J.
Warren and S. Rixner have developed an AMAZING course here. Where to begin?
First of all, I am not a gamer, but the course uses game development to apply
Python techniques. It is so rewarding to actually create something ""tangible""
with what you are learning. They developed a web based coding environment that
can be accessed from most devices. They teach with good humor. They provide
detailed, step-by-step guidance through the projects to assure that the
CONCEPTS are re-enforced while the student is still succeeding at building the
project. Awesome! Also, as usual, Coursera's forum's provide a massive amount
of content above and beyond the course from the diverse mix of other students.
Highly recommend this course!

Python. The course was well structured and lectures a delight to view. This
course is far far better than another Coursera course on programming I had
enrolled for. Excellent ! Really enjoyed it ! Look forward to another course

                    I had no real prior experience with programming, certainly not professionally.
I had recently had a go at a few codeacademy classes, learned how to put a
very basic website together and a few text based games but that really was it.
I don't normally feel compelled to write reviews or recommendations but I feel
I owe it to Scott Rixner and Joe Warren after what they've done for me and so
many other over the last 9 weeks. I've really enjoyed the projects and always
found the end result to be a satisfying achievement. If like me you have no
real programming experience, the lectures give you the tools you need to
complete the projects, but after about week 4 you really start to need to
dedicate a good few hours of time, debugging and working things out in order
to make things work. The learning curve is manageable because of the quality
of the lectures and the help available through the very active community.
There was never a problem i encountered or a question I had that hadn't
already been covered in the forums. I wasn't an active member, but the one
time I did post something I received 3 replies helping me out within an hour.
The weekly deadlines may not be for everybody, but I found that even when my
enthusiasm may have started to waver and it all became quite a lot of effort,
it kept me coming back and plugging away to get the job done before the
deadline. The morale boost of completing the task gave me new energy to
complete the next one, and the quality of the lectures gives you the belief
that you can complete the next task no matter how much you struggled with the
last one. I would personally found Scott Rixner's lectures to be exceptional,
breaking down complex ideas into manageable structured pieces with a
knowledgeable authority whilst never coming across as patronising. On a final
point I just feel I should say having completed the course I am in no way an
expert, I dont even feel particularly capable or going out and doing anything
further on my own, but that doesnt really matter I dont think. I feel ready to
take a more advanced course which is something I would look at and the
achievement of having played games that I created (no matter how simple and
with however much help) has definitely sparked my enthusiasm for programming
more than any other course I've taken. Thoroughly recommended and thanks very
much, Scott, Joe and John. Joe Crocker UK.

you right into successful programming. Yeah, they do a lot of hand holding and

Python scripts but had no GUI programming experience. The course was well
pitched, covering basic data types and constructs in a clear and accessible
way while managing to sneak in some more advanced concepts. The course began
simple and managed to move through more challenging topics without making the
learning curve too steep. The tone of the course was playful but the quality
of the course in terms of lectures, exercises, quizzes, guidance and support
was extremely high. Staff frequently addressed questions in the forum and
provided additional help through email. I recommend this course to anyone who
has an interest in learning about programming generally or wants a structured
route into GUI/game development.

this course is great too!! Forums are engaging. The Video competition is a

How do you grade 40,000 assignments in one week? You provide a very careful
rubric and you do peer review. This is actually the toughest part of the
class, because your peers are even less forgiving than the professors would
be.

                    This class was great, you learn a lot very quickly. It is truly focused on
interactive programming, and so basic programming principles are only dealt
with briefly. It really helps to have taken another introductory programming
course before you take this one so that you already know programming basics.
The programming language the course uses is Python 2.7.

                    the things i liked about the course is the way the instructors teaches the
concepts. i was expecting moderate difficulty and so it was. i think rather
than only running behind games and simplegui the course could have been spread
more around the other topics and be more focused on the real version of
simplegui. i dont think there would be any prereq required for the course but
a bit of programming background is a bit motivational :)

material to heights I never expected to reach. I am happy that there were hard
deadlines on the submission of quizzes and mine-projects; without deadlines
most of us put it all off until the last minute and don't learn as much as we
could. My only suggestion for ""improvement"" is that there be more of it!! I
would suggest some comfort with high school math as a prerequisite; a number
of students in the beginning were quite upset about having to deal with fairly
fundamental algebra. This is the first MOOC that I have taken, so I have no
standard of comparison - but if this course is any indication of the general
standard of excellence of MOOCs, then this will truly be ""disruptive
technology"". More power to it!!

The most exciting thing about this course is that you get to build your own

helpful for future students if they spend a bit of time on object oriented
design, so those chapters don't throw them for a curve ball. These instructors

could build a simple game of my own design using the knowledge and experience
I had gained in just 8 weeks. Yes, it was challenging. Every project pushed me
to the edge of almost quitting, but I persevered and had a break-through
moment every time. The faculty managed to explain complicate concepts in a
straightforward manner, the course was well planned, and the support for
people like me who kept running into mental brick walls (from both the faculty
and other students on the course forums) was amazing! I cannot recommend this
course highly enough, and I'll definitely be signing up again if this team
decides to run an intermediate Python course.

                    I loved this course. The work is hard but rewarding as you see what you have
learned by completing the quiz and projects. I have taken several Coursera
courses. This is the second one I completed, the only one which involved
programing. I have been trying to understand how to program and finally 'got
it'!! Everyone who wants to learn more about computers should take this class.
Thanks Prof. Warren, Prof. Rixner, Prof. Greiner, and Prof. Wong.

                    This class was a a truly outstanding experience that has single-handedly
changed my opinion of MOOCs, and online education in general. I have a class I
honours degree, as well as a various industry certifications and
qualifications I've accumulated over the years, yet I can genuinely say that
this class has been the best eight weeks of education I have ever experienced.
Throughout it has been obvious that the syllabus, the course structure, the
delivery methods, and the continuous engagement, all reflected many hours of
careful thought, planning, and effort. I always felt the focus was clear, the
right knowledge being presented at the right moment, and support was available
if needed. By the end of the last project I really did feel almost as though I
was 'standing on the shoulders of giants' - and surely that is the best
complement any student could ever give. I will keeping my eyes peeled on
coursera in future for the names Joe, Scott, and John. I hope I might one day
be able to take a class of this quality again

                    Wonderful course. Highly recommended. You will go learn not only Python basics
but also will help you to understand event driven programming, OO programming
and basics for game development. Don't be scared about the topics, professors
(the best ones I've ever met) and the vibrant community will help you to
achieve all the goals with a reasonable effort from your side. I personally
had a lot of fun and got it with just a little programming background and
being absolutely new to event programming, OO or game development. If you are
interested in any or all this topics this is an opportunity that you shouldn't
miss !

                    This was my first programming course. I learned about modular math and how
formulas control the behavior of game assets that tell the program to detect
collision whether a ball bounces off a paddle or an asteroid collides with a
spacecraft. The instructors made fun videos and difficult quizzes. I really
looked forward each week to making a video game. My favorites were pong and
asteroids. I would suggest trigonometry as an possible prerequisite. Rice
ROCKS!

week's homework and mini-project, but not so much that the assignments were
boring. Nearly every week, I thought I reached a point where I just couldn't
figure out what needed to be done, but after a review of the lecture and a
night sleeping on it, the topics would always click. I would highly recommend
this course and any others offered by these instructors.
