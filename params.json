  "body": "### Short Description\r\nThis project was implemented as part of a master's thesis in Information Systems at the Humboldt University of Berlin. The project focuses on the automatic identification of salient terms related to student drop-outs among Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).\r\n\r\nWithin the past few years, MOOCs have experienced a sudden rise in popularity, reaching thousands of students across the globe and bridging limitations that higher education has experienced until present. Despite the great potential MOOCs represent to the future of global education, a high drop-out phenomenon (96%)\r\nhas been regularly reported over the years. This project investigates this phenomenon and uses Sentiment Analysis and other Text Mining techniques to identify topics related to the student drop-out. \r\n \r\n### Structure\r\nThe project is structured according with the KDD process. The data was self-collected with a crawler written in Python for this project. The data was then normalized. A quantitative text analysis was performed prior to \r\nthe polarity classification and term extraction to better adapt the classification process. All non-textual features were also analyzed to obtain insights from the dataset. In order to separate negative from positive reviews, a polarity classification was performed using a lexicon-based approach. Furthermore the target data was \r\nsyntactically annotated in order to identify opinion words and nouns suggesting opinion targets. Finally the TF-IDF score was used in order to identify salient terms which were then clustered. \r\n\r\n### Files\r\n* Python:\r\n  * urls_extr.py\r\nCrawler to extract list of courses alongside non textual features and url\r\n  * reviews_extr.py: \r\nCrawler to extract list of reviews for each selected course\r\n\r\n* R:\r\n  * url_sel_prep.R\r\nCourse selection process\r\n  * reviews_impl.R\r\nImplementation of the project. Includes review and data (non-textual features) preparation, statistical analysis and quantitative text analysis. The polarity classification is also included and finally the identification of \r\nsalient terms with TF-IDF.\r\n\r\n* LaTeX:\r\n  * main_thesis.tex\r\nLaTeX source of the final thesis pdf.\r\n  * main_thesis.bib\r\nBibliography of the final thesis. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe data was extracted from the MOOC platform Coursetalk.com to whom I thank for their support. Otherwise please refer to the paper when using this data or paper.",
