<p>This project was implemented as part of a master's thesis in Information Systems at the Humboldt University of Berlin. The project focuses on the automatic identification of salient terms related to student drop-outs among Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).</p>

<p>Within the past few years, MOOCs have experienced a sudden rise in popularity, reaching thousands of students across the globe and bridging limitations that higher education has experienced until present. Despite the great potential MOOCs represent to the future of global education, a high drop-out phenomenon (96%)
has been regularly reported over the years. This project investigates this phenomenon and uses Sentiment Analysis and other Text Mining techniques to identify topics related to the student drop-out. </p>

<a id="structure" class="anchor" href="#structure" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Structure</h3>

<p>The project is structured according with the KDD process. The data was self-collected with a crawler written in Python for this project. The data was then normalized. A quantitative text analysis was performed prior to 
the polarity classification and term extraction to better adapt the classification process. All non-textual features were also analyzed to obtain insights from the dataset. In order to separate negative from positive reviews, a polarity classification was performed using a lexicon-based approach. Furthermore the target data was 
syntactically annotated in order to identify opinion words and nouns suggesting opinion targets. Finally the TF-IDF score was used in order to identify salient terms which were then clustered. </p>
