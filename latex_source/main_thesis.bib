	abstract = "The Web has enabled one of the most visible recent developments in education--the deployment of massive open online courses. With their global reach and often staggering enrollments, MOOCs have the potential to become a major new mechanism for learning. Despite this early promise, however, MOOCs are still relatively unexplored and poorly understood. In a MOOC, each student's complete interaction with the course materials takes place on the Web, thus providing a record of learner activity of unprecedented scale and resolution. In this work, we use such trace data to develop a conceptual framework for understanding how users currently engage with MOOCs. We develop a taxonomy of individual behavior, examine the different behavioral patterns of high- and low-achieving students, and investigate how forum participation relates to other parts of the course. We also report on a large-scale deployment of badges as incentives for engagement in a MOOC, including randomized experiments in which the presentation of badges was varied across sub-populations. We find that making badges more salient produced increases in forum engagement.",

	abstract = "Over the past few years, observers of higher education have speculated about dramatic changes that must occur to accommodate more learners at lower costs and to facilitate a shift away from the accumulation of knowledge to the acquisition of a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. All scenarios feature a major role for technology and online learning. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are the most recent candidates being pushed forward to fulfill these ambitious goals. To date, there has been little evidence collected that would allow an assessment of whether MOOCs do indeed provide a cost-effective mechanism for producing desirable educational outcomes at scale. It is not even clear that these are the goals of those institutions offering MOOCs. This report investigates the actual goals of institutions creating MOOCs or integrating them into their programs, and reviews the current evidence regarding whether and how these goals are being achieved, and at what cost.",

It allows researchers to share scripts/effort, compare results and attempts to engage the community to achieve shared educational science goals. The platform utilizes some well known tools and packages and provides multiple levels of access to address a wide variety of needs around the data. We demonstrate the platforms capability by analyzing data from two MOOCs, one from coursera (offered by Stanford University) and one fromedX (offered byMITx). This is the first time two courses from two platforms have been jointly analyzed. The analysis and the platform is made possible due to joint adoption of a data model called MoocDB.",

The types of interactions in such threads vary: there are discussions on close ended problems (e.g. solutions to assignments), open ended topics, course logistics, or just small talk among fellow students. We first study the evolution of the forum activities with respect to the normalized course duration. Then we investigate several language independent features to classify the discussion threads based on the types of the interactions among the users. We use default Coursera subforum categories (Study Groups, Assignments, Lectures,...) to define the classes of interest and so the labels. We extract features related to structure, popularity, temporal dynamics of threads and diversity of the ids of the users. Text related features, word count aside, are avoided to apply the methods across discussion threads written in different languages and with various technical terminologies. Experiments show a classification performance with ROCAUC between 0.58 and 0.89, depending on the subforum class considered and with possibly noisy labels.",

The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., ?subtle nuances?) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., ?very cavalier?). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word ?excellent? minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word ?poor?. A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74{\%} when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84{\%} for automobile reviews to 66{\%} for movie reviews.",

Recent years brought increased interest in applying ma- chine learning techniques to difficult "real-world" problems, many of which are characterized by imbalanced data. Additionally the distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced andlor the costs of different errors vary markedly. In this Chapter, we discuss some of the sampling techniques used for balancing the datasets, and the performance measures more appropriate for mining imbalanced datasets.},

While a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of similarity. To address this problem, we conducted an experiment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. An analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. We then considered the ability of existing modelsusing wordbased, n-gram and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approachesto model these human judgments. The best performed LSA model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. Many of the remaining models showed almost no correlation with human performance. Based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined.",

This paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. Most existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are context dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these rules and the function are highly effective. A system, called Opinion Observer, has also been built.",
