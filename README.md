# Title: 
Identification of Disengagement Factors using Sentiment Analysis and TF-IDF

# Description: 
This is the documentation repository for the master thesis: 
"MOOC Interrupted Determination of Disengagement Factors using
Sentiment Analysis" at the Humboldt University of Berlin (Sept 2016).

# Abstract of the project:
Within the past few years, Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), have experienced a
sudden rise in popularity, reaching thousands of students across the globe and bridging
limitations that higher education has experienced until present. Despite the great potential
MOOCs represent to the future of global education, a high drop-out phenomenon (96%)
has been regularly reported over the years. This thesis investigates this phenomenon and uses Sentiment Analysis and other Text Mining techniques to identify topics related to the student drop-out. An en-to-end framework
is presented including data extraction (50K textual reviews) and preparation, polarity classification and feature
selection. Using the proposed framework, topics related to student dissatisfaction were
found, supporting findings from previous studies. Furthermore, quantitative text metrics were used to identify linguistic patterns among dissatisfied studentsâ€™ reviews, finding significant correlations with course features such as
price, rating and polarity.
